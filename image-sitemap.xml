      <image:title>Design learning for decision quality not completion rates</image:title>
      <image:caption>Learning design often traps us in a completion game. We track how many courses learners finish instead of how well they apply what they learned.</image:caption>

      <image:title>The Object Without Attachment</image:title>
      <image:caption>Humans are wired to bond with things we work through, not just finish. When AI compresses effort, you get the result without the emotional imprint that normally makes it feel yours.</image:caption>
