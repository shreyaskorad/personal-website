## Agent 1: Topic Scout

**Candidate Topics:**
1. Autonomous writing sprint: Help cross functional teams learn faster through shared project reflection (selected - high practical relevance to LXD/facilitation)
2. AI-assisted facilitation techniques for distributed team learning (rejected - too operational/tech-focused)
3. Data-informed meeting design that improves team outcomes (rejected - process-meta content)

**Topic Selected:** Autonomous writing sprint: Help cross functional teams learn faster through shared project reflection

**Thesis:** Cross-functional teams learn faster when they reflect on shared projects through autonomous writing sprints.

**Audience Intent:** Team leads, facilitators, and L&D practitioners seeking practical methods to accelerate team learning.

**Team Notes to Integrate:**
- Evidence-based learning that links to business metrics shows higher adoption (source: learning impact research)
- Include reflective question about business questions and practical application
