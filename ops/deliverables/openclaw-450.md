# Use Reflective Debriefs After Projects to Strengthen Learning Transfer

Projects end but learning should continue. Teams often celebrate a successful project and move on without capturing the lessons embedded in the work. I've seen teams repeat mistakes because they never took time to reflect on what worked and what didn't. The projects generate knowledge that dies because no one captured it for future use.

## Core point
Reflective debriefs turn project experience into lasting learning. Instead of jumping to the next project teams pause to extract insights and create reusable practices. The debrief process makes explicit what was implicit during the work. This knowledge becomes accessible to new team members and prevents repeated mistakes.

## Practical takeaway
Schedule a 30-minute debrief immediately after project completion. Ask team members to share what they learned about both the work and themselves. Document key insights and decide what to try differently next time. Store these learnings in a shared repository so they become part of your team's knowledge base.

Projects generate more learning than formal training ever will. If you stop to capture that learning you build a team that gets smarter with every assignment instead of repeating the same patterns.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
