# L&D operating model for teams with weekly execution rhythm

## Why this matters
L&D operating model for teams with weekly execution rhythm matters because learning work is often measured by completion instead of capability. Better outcomes come when teams define the decision that should improve and track whether behavior changed in real work.

## What usually goes wrong
Programs drift when goals are vague, evidence is collected too late, and stakeholders only see activity updates. That creates busy calendars but weak business confidence in learning impact.

## A practical approach
Start with one concrete capability goal, connect it to one business metric, and run a short cycle with a practical example. Review evidence weekly, not quarterly, and adjust the next sprint based on what changed in decisions and behavior.

## Closing
L&D operating model for teams with weekly execution rhythm becomes credible when learning evidence is tied to business outcomes and used to improve decisions every week. That is how the work moves from content delivery to measurable capability growth.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
