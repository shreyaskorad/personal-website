  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This creates a disconnect between learner activity and organizational value. A learner might finish a compliance module quickly yet still struggle to apply knowledge during critical moments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time or course progress, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy, and confidence serve as reliable indicators of knowledge transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning intervention help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about.",
