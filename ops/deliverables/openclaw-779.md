## Deliverable Output
# Make learning evidence useful for business reviews without heavy reporting overhead

Learning evidence often sits in spreadsheets collecting digital dust instead of shaping decisions. I watched a director struggle to show impact until she cut her reporting from quarterly PDFs to one weekly slide. She pulled data from existing systems and highlighted just two trends instead of ten. The board finally understood what mattered.

## Core point

Pull learning data from existing systems instead of building new reports. One director reduced her quarterly PDF to a single weekly slide showing only what mattered. The board finally understood the impact instead of drowning in dashboards. This saved time and made the evidence more actionable for stakeholders.

## Practical takeaway

What single metric would make your learning case most compelling? Build that into your existing reports instead of creating new documentation. Share it weekly rather than quarterly to keep it top-of-mind.

Evidence becomes useful when it reaches the right people at the right time without extra work. Directors who pull data from existing systems and focus on what matters create more value than those who build elaborate reporting frameworks.
