# Design onboarding that builds role judgment instead of checklist compliance

When I look at most onboarding programs, I see endless checklists that train people to follow rules rather than make sound judgments. I believe onboarding should focus on developing decision-making muscle instead of just tracking compliance items.

## Core point

You might think a checklist approach guarantees consistency, but it actually limits flexibility and slows down experienced professionals who need to make nuanced decisions. Instead, consider scenarios where learners face ambiguous situations and must choose their own path, then debrief their choices in a supportive environment.

## Practical takeaway

In my experience, a peer-mentor system works well. New hires shadow senior staff on real projects, then discuss what they observed and how they would have responded. This builds confidence and prepares them for the unpredictable nature of their role.

How could you redesign your onboarding to prioritize judgment over compliance?

When we focus on judgment, we create onboarding that truly prepares people to handle the complexities of their role, rather than just following a static list of steps.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
