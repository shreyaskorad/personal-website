## Deliverable Output
```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "summary": "Duplicate title issue persists",
  "blockers": "Task still references the same topic as blocked post. New task description does not provide a specific title. The truncated title 'pr' (cut off from 'practical AI') is not sufficient to identify a unique article topic.",
  "next_steps": "Provide a specific, unique title. This could be: 1) Specific domain focus (AI learning design, gamification for decision quality, LXD for small teams), 2) Time-based angle (for new hires vs experienced practitioners), 3) Outcome focus (reduce onboarding time, improve decision accuracy), 4) Methodology focus (feedback loops, judgment drills, cognitive diversity). Once a unique title is provided, proceed with full publishing pipeline.",

      "note": "Task re-issue received but truncated title prevents topic identification. Previous block reason remains valid. Need specific title to proceed with topic selection and duplication check.",
      "action_hint": "Block and request complete title. Do not proceed with generic descriptions like 'L&D, gamification, LXD, data-informed learning, and practical AI use in learning'. These are focus areas, not titles.",
