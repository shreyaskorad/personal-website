## Deliverable Output
# Improve judgment without adding course fatigue

Most learning programs punish judgment by forcing endless courses. I saw a software team drowning in compliance training until their leader redesigned their onboarding around real decisions. New engineers made critical choices on actual projects while learning, not through simulated scenarios that felt disconnected from reality. Their error rate dropped without any additional classroom time.

## Core point

Practice judgment in actual work contexts to build skills without adding course fatigue. A software team designed their onboarding around real decisions and reduced errors without more training hours. They gave new engineers problems to solve with guidance from experienced mentors. The hands-on approach built judgment faster than isolated classroom modules ever could.

## Practical takeaway

Where can you give your team more real decision-making opportunities instead of more training? Start with small project assignments and pair experienced mentors with learners. Let them wrestle with real problems under guidance rather than watching videos that never touch their actual work.

Judgment lives in the struggle to solve real problems, not in the comfort of passive learning. Teams that apply what they learn during the work they already do build capability faster than those who take time away for separate training sessions.
