## Deliverable Output
# Design without losing human judgment

AI tools are moving faster than most learning teams can absorb, and that gap creates a real design risk.

## Core point
I watched a design team use AI to draft a leadership scenario in minutes, then spend far longer repairing what mattered most. The language sounded polished, but the tradeoffs were shallow and the context felt generic. The draft was fast, yet the decision quality was weak.

## Practical takeaway
AI can accelerate structure, options, and first drafts, but it cannot own consequences. In workplace learning, consequences are everything. If a learner applies the advice in a tense conversation tomorrow, who carries the cost of a bad call?

When teams treat AI as a partner in production and keep judgment as the final gate, output gets sharper and trust stays intact. Speed still matters, but direction matters more. That is the balance worth protecting.

## Blockers / Notes
Publish quality gate failed.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
