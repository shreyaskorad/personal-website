  "article_content":"Hiring teams often prioritize speed to fill roles quickly. This can lead to poor long-term fits. Decision quality metrics solve this issue. Instead of measuring time-to-hire, evaluate outcomes of selections over time. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of good hiring. Consider a project management scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did the new hire succeed in the role after six months? Measuring decision quality requires clear criteria and a feedback loop. Teams define what a good decision looks like for specific roles and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift connects learning directly to retention rates and performance goals. By measuring decision quality, L&D can ensure training programs contribute to better outcomes rather than just faster hires.",
