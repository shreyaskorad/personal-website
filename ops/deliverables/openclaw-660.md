# Improve judgment without adding course fatigue

Teams often seek new training programs to boost decision quality without realizing they already have capacity for more. Effective learning transfers happen when teams apply existing knowledge in new situations. One company structured weekly problem-solving sessions where teams explicitly discussed what decisions they were making and what knowledge they applied. They also reflected on what they could improve next week. This approach increased decision confidence without requiring additional training hours or resources.
