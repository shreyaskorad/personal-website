### Calorie Strategy

**Active Calorie Deficit**: Target daily deficit of 300-400 kcal per day during active weight loss phases
**Maintenance Phases**: Target 0-200 kcal deficit during maintenance periods
**Calorie Range**: 1,550-2,100 kcal based on activity level and phase
**Nutrient Balance**: 30% protein, 35% healthy fats, 35% complex carbohydrates
**Meal Structure**: 3 main meals + 1-2 snacks, with protein at each meal

### Activity Plan

**Weekday Routine**:
- Morning: 20 min cardio (walking, cycling, or light jog)
- Lunch break: 10 min walking or stretch
- Evening: 30-45 min moderate exercise (weights, HIIT, sports)

**Weekend Routine**:
- 60 min moderate exercise (hiking, cycling, swimming)
- Active lifestyle: weekend activities, gardening, family outings

### Tracking System

**Daily Tracking**:
- Weigh-in: Morning (fasted), record in app or journal
- Food logging: All meals and snacks using calorie-counting app
- Water intake: Minimum 2.5-3 liters/day

**Weekly Tracking**:
- Body measurements: Weight, waist, hip, body fat percentage
- Activity log: Record exercise type, duration, intensity
- Meal consistency: Rate meal quality 1-5
- Energy levels: Track daily energy and sleep quality

**Monthly Review**:
- Weight trend analysis
- Identify patterns and challenges
- Adjust calorie targets based on progress
- Plan ahead for upcoming months

### Nutrition Guidelines

**Protein Sources**: Lean meats, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, legumes, tofu, protein supplements
**Carbohydrate Sources**: Whole grains, oats, quinoa, brown rice, fruits, vegetables
**Fat Sources**: Avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish, natural nut butters
**Limit**: Processed foods, sugary drinks, alcohol, high-calorie snacks
**Emphasis**: Whole foods, high fiber, adequate hydration

### Habits to Develop

1. **Morning Routine**: 10-15 minutes of light exercise and stretching before breakfast
2. **Mindful Eating**: No screens while eating, chew slowly, stop when 80% full
3. **Meal Prep**: Prepare healthy meals and snacks in advance to avoid unhealthy choices
4. **Sleep Hygiene**: 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night to support weight management
5. **Stress Management**: Regular relaxation techniques to prevent stress-related eating
6. **Self-Compassion**: Practice non-judgmental tracking and celebrate small wins

## Decisions and Assumptions

### Key Decisions

1. **Gradual Approach**: Chose steady, sustainable weight loss (1 kg/month) rather than aggressive rapid weight loss to prevent metabolic slowdown and ensure long-term success

2. **Calorie-Based Targeting**: Based calorie targets on moderate daily deficit of 300-400 kcal, which is achievable through diet alone and sustainable over long periods

3. **Monthly Adjustments**: Implemented progressive calorie targets that become more challenging during active weight loss phases then relax during maintenance, preventing burnout

4. **Dual Track**: Combined diet and exercise approaches rather than relying on either alone, creating synergistic effects and better overall health benefits

5. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Emphasized multi-dimensional tracking (weight, measurements, activity, food, energy) rather than just weight to provide more complete feedback

### Assumptions

1. **Current Baseline Accuracy**: Assumes current weight of 78 kg is accurate and representative of sustainable starting point

2. **Activity Level**: Assumes moderate daily activity (150-200 min exercise/week) is realistic and sustainable for user's lifestyle

3. **Calorie Baseline**: Assumes typical maintenance calories around 2,200-2,400 kcal, allowing for targeted deficits of 300-400 kcal

4. **Consistency**: Assumes user can maintain consistent tracking and follow-through with the plan throughout the 11-month period

5. **No Medical Constraints**: Assumes no underlying medical conditions that would impact weight loss goals or calorie targets

6. **Lifestyle Flexibility**: Assumes user's schedule and commitments allow for the proposed activity and meal timing structure

7. **Nutritional Balance**: Assumes user can meet nutritional needs while maintaining calorie deficits through food choices

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)

2. **Start Exercise Routine**: Begin with 150 min moderate exercise per week, gradually increasing
3. **Monitor Energy Levels**: Track how different foods and activity levels affect daily energy
4. **Weekly Check-ins**: Review progress weekly, adjust targets if needed based on actual progress
5. **Adjust as Needed**: If weight loss is too slow or too fast, adjust calorie targets accordingly

### First Quarter (February-April)

1. **Bi-Weekly Measurements**: Take body measurements every 2 weeks in addition to weekly weigh-ins
