## Summary
Capture task, create template with execution slots and priority order

## Deliverable Output
# Weekly Schedule and Execution Template

## Objective
Create a practical, actionable weekly planning template with structured daily execution slots and clear priority order to optimize time management and task completion.

## Final Output
Complete weekly planning template with dedicated time blocks for each day (Monday/Tuesday deep work, Wednesday/Thursday mid-work, Friday low work, Saturday review, Sunday rest), daily execution template, priority order framework (must-do/should-do/could-do/won't-do), and weekly review system.

## Execution Details
**Task Capture and Design**: Successfully captured task into workflow system, created 7-day weekly structure with time blocks, designed daily execution template with morning/afternoon/evening blocks, developed priority order framework, built weekly review system for continuous improvement.

**Template Components**: Monday/Tuesday deep work blocks (9am-12pm) for complex tasks, Wednesday/Thursday mid-work blocks (10am-1pm) for review and analysis, Friday low work block (11am-2pm) for admin and planning, Saturday review block (10am-1pm) for reflection, Sunday rest block (1pm-4pm). Priority framework ensures 1-3 high-impact tasks daily.

**Current Status**: Template fully designed and documented in weekly-schedule.md (3,550 bytes), time blocks clearly defined, priority framework operational, review system established, ready for immediate use.

## Decisions and Assumptions
**Key Decisions**: Deep work on high-energy days, structured blocks prevent distraction, priority framework forces intentional selection, weekend includes work but also rest, template adaptable to individual needs, consistent practice builds habits.

**Assumptions**: Predictable energy patterns exist, 8-10 hours daily available for work, mix of work types each day, weekends include rest, template adaptable to individual needs, practice builds habits over 21 days.

## Suggested Next Actions
**Immediate**: Review weekly-schedule.md, customize time blocks to your patterns, create template in preferred format, execute one week to test effectiveness.

**Short-Term**: Monitor adherence and energy patterns, practice priority framework consistently, identify patterns and adjust, establish metrics tracking system.

**Success Metrics**: 40% increase in task completion rate, 30% reduction in context switching, 35% improvement in work-life balance, 50% increase in quality, user satisfaction >4/5 over 3 months.
