## Summary
Capture task, create template with execution slots and priority order

## Deliverable Output
# Weekly Schedule and Execution Template

## Objective
Create a practical, actionable weekly planning template with structured daily execution slots and clear priority order to optimize time management and task completion across work and life commitments.

## Final Output
Complete weekly planning template with dedicated time blocks for each day (Monday/Tuesday deep work, Wednesday/Thursday mid-work, Friday low work, Saturday review, Sunday rest), daily execution template with morning/afternoon/evening blocks, priority order framework (must-do/should-do/could-do/won't-do), and weekly review system.

## Execution Details

**Task Capture and Template Design**: Successfully captured task into workflow system as task-1770573998035-b7h1, created 7-day weekly structure with dedicated time blocks, designed daily execution template with morning (8am-12pm), afternoon (2pm-5pm), evening (7pm-8pm) blocks, developed priority order framework with must-do/should-do/could-do/won't-do matrix, built weekly review template with metrics analysis, pattern identification, and next week planning.

**Template Components Created**:
- **Monday (9am-12pm)**: Deep work block for most complex, high-impact work
- **Tuesday (9am-12pm)**: Deep work block for complex execution and implementation
- **Wednesday (10am-1pm)**: Mid-work block for medium complexity review and analysis
- **Thursday (10am-1pm)**: Mid-work block for medium complexity execution
- **Friday (11am-2pm)**: Low work block for admin, review, planning
- **Saturday (10am-1pm)**: Review block for weekly review and planning
- **Sunday (1pm-4pm)**: Rest block for recovery and preparation

**Priority Order Framework**: Must-do (critical tasks with deadlines), Should-do (high priority tasks without strict deadlines), Could-do (medium priority, nice to have), Won't-do (defer or skip). Forces intentional task selection with 1-3 high-impact tasks per day maximum.

**Documentation Created**: Comprehensive weekly planning documentation in weekly-schedule.md (3,550 bytes) with complete structure, time blocks, task selection rules, success metrics, and practical guidance. Template fully designed and ready for immediate use.

## Decisions and Assumptions

**Key Design Decisions**: Deep work blocks on high-energy days prevent distraction, structured review time prevents drift, priority framework forces intentional selection, weekend includes work but also rest, template adaptable to individual needs, consistent practice builds sustainable habits.

**Assumptions**: Predictable energy patterns exist, can dedicate 8-10 hours daily to work, each day includes mix of work types, weekends include work but also rest, template adaptable to individual needs, consistent practice builds habits over 21 days.

**Integration Constraints**: Compatible with existing taskflow.js WIP=1 discipline, works within model limits through time-window based execution, supports existing review gate system, no changes to core workflow states, enhances task completion through better planning.

## Suggested Next Actions

**Immediate Implementation** (This Week):
- Review weekly-schedule.md documentation thoroughly
- Customize time blocks to match your energy patterns
- Create weekly template in your preferred format
- Execute one week using the template

**Short-Term Practice** (2 Weeks):
- Monitor adherence to weekly structure and energy patterns
- Track energy levels each day and correlate with tasks
- Practice the priority order framework consistently
- Identify patterns and adjust based on actual usage

**Medium-Term Optimization** (Month 1):
- Adjust time blocks based on energy patterns and data
- Refine task selection rules based on what works
- Develop personal rules for daily planning
- Establish consistent metrics tracking system

**Long-Term Evolution**:
- Adapt template to your evolving needs and circumstances
- Optimize based on long-term patterns and data
- Build culture of weekly review and refinement
- Use template to achieve better work-life balance

**Success Metrics**: 40% increase in task completion rate, 30% reduction in context switching, 35% improvement in work-life balance, 50% increase in quality of completed work, user satisfaction >4/5 with weekly planning, clear improvement in time management over 3 months.
