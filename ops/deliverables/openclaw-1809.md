  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual capability building. This creates a false sense of value where learners might finish modules quickly but still struggle to apply knowledge during critical moments. Decision quality metrics solve this disconnect. Instead of tracking seat time or course progress, teams should measure the outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario where a learning intervention enables a manager to choose the best candidate based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling. Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and establishing a feedback loop. Teams define criteria and learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how L&D demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better business outcomes rather than just a cost center.",
