## Agent 1: Topic Scout

**Candidate Topics:**
1. Build a practical LXD workflow for small teams shipping weekly (selected - high practical relevance to LXD and iterative learning)
2. AI-powered design sprints for iterative product development (rejected - product-focused, not LXD-focused)
3. Data-informed facilitation techniques for distributed teams (rejected - too operational/process-meta)

**Topic Selected:** Build a practical LXD workflow for small teams shipping weekly

**Thesis:** Small teams that ship weekly benefit from a streamlined learning experience design workflow that keeps learning integrated with product delivery.

**Audience Intent:** Team leads and L&D practitioners seeking practical LXD methods for agile, product-focused environments.

**Team Notes to Integrate:**
- Evidence-based learning that links to business metrics shows higher adoption (source: learning impact research)
- Include reflective question about business questions and practical application
