  "article_content":"Static coding tutorials often prioritize seat time over actual developer velocity. This disconnect prevents teams from learning to apply knowledge when a bug blocks release. AI-powered adaptive learning solves this by generating dynamic, personalized scenarios. Instead of generic modules, developers face simulations tailored to their specific codebase and context. This approach improves decision quality in the moment of need. Consider a debugging scenario. Does the learning environment help a developer choose the right tool for a specific stack based on performance data rather than gut feeling? Does it reduce the time to identify the root cause compared to previous sprints? Measuring decision quality in AI-assisted learning requires tracking the impact of AI suggestions on real outcomes. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Validating investment in AI tools requires proving that they drive better code quality and uptime. By measuring decision quality, L&D teams can show that AI-driven learning is a driver of better software delivery.",
