  "article_content":"Workplace learning often prioritizes course completion over strategic impact. This disconnect prevents leaders from validating critical roadmap decisions. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time, measure outcomes of real-time strategic decisions. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators. Consider a strategic planning scenario. Did the learning program help a product manager choose between competing roadmap options based on market data rather than internal politics? Did it reduce the time spent on low-impact initiatives compared to previous quarters? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good strategic decision looks like. Leaders receive guidance on how their choices align with market standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics stakeholders care about.",
