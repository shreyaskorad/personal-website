## Agent 1: Topic Scout

**Candidate Topics:**
1. Gamification metrics that actually correlate with performance (rejected - too process-focused)
2. Onboarding design that builds role judgment instead of checklist compliance (selected - high practical relevance)
3. AI-powered feedback loops for 360-degree reviews (rejected - operational focus)

**Topic Selected:** Design onboarding that builds role judgment instead of checklist compliance

**Thesis:** Onboarding that trains judgment over compliance connects learning outcomes to business decisions, not administrative tasks.

**Audience Intent:** Practitioners seeking evidence-based design patterns that improve retention and application.

**Team Notes to Integrate:**
- Evidence-based learning that links to business metrics shows higher adoption (source: learning impact research)
- Include reflective question: "What business question does your learning evidence answer?"
