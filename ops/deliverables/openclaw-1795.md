  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual capability building. A learner might finish a module and still struggle to apply knowledge when it matters most. This disconnect weakens the business case for learning investments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time, measure the outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy, and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager identify the best candidate based on specific role requirements? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires clear criteria and a feedback loop. Teams define what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how L&D demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is not just a cost center but a driver of better business outcomes. This approach moves beyond inputs to outputs.",
