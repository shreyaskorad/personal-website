## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2133)

I evaluate decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2133) by watching one real workflow and asking whether the team handles trade-offs with less confusion this week than last week. Completion metrics can still look strong while workplace behavior stays flat.

A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.

You can run a short pilot around a focused behavior change, then document what shifted in the team conversation and what did not. That record is more useful than adding another generic course asset.

Over time, teams build a cleaner evidence trail because each article connects a real scenario, a decision rule, and a reflection point. That continuity is what compounds learning value across iterations.

I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.

Where in your next manager check-in could you replace activity updates with a sharper conversation about decision quality?
