- Schedule regular review sessions to refine process
- Build in buffer time for unexpected issues

## Failure Handling and Fallback Logic

**Agent-Level Failure Scenarios**:

**Topic Scout Failure**:

- **Recovery**: Expand search terms and sources
- **Prevention**: Build curated source library

- **Recovery**: Focus on clarity over creativity
- **Prevention**: Provide detailed brief and examples

**SEO Optimizer Failure**:

- **Prevention**: Use readability scoring tools

**Publishing QA Failure**:

- **Recovery**: Escalate to human for manual publish
- **Prevention**: Thorough pre-publish validation

**Process-Level Failure Scenarios**:

**Performance Degradation** (>5 minutes per agent):

- **Fallback**: Streamline agent responsibilities
- **Recovery**: Analyze bottlenecks and optimize
- **Prevention**: Implement time tracking and alerts

**Quality Gates Failure**:
- **Issue**: Cannot pass quality gates
- **Fallback**: Request human intervention for critical issues
- **Recovery**: Address specific failures and retry

- **Prevention**: Maintain source alternatives

**Measurement Gap**:

**Recovery Workflow**:
1. Identify failure mode and root cause
2. Apply appropriate fallback strategy
3. Document failure and recovery in team_notes
