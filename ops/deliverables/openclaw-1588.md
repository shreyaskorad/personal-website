# Use reflective debriefs after projects to strengthen learning transfer

Learning disappears when feedback stays in the classroom. You implement brilliant programs yet teams show no visible change in their day-to-day work. I have watched countless LxD initiatives where post-training surveys showed perfect satisfaction scores yet the actual behavior on the floor never shifted. The gap between learning and living becomes permanent.

Teams absorb new concepts but struggle to apply them because feedback feels ad-hoc and inconsistent. They complete training programs with enthusiastic participants yet watch weeks later as nothing changes. The learning dies because there is no ritual that forces people to practice and get feedback.

Reflective debriefs turn learning into visible team behavior by creating structured opportunities to apply new skills in real contexts. When feedback happens during work rather than after training you surface immediate insights about what worked and what needs adjustment. The moments people pause and think about what to do next are the ones that actually stick.

What would your team look like if they could make confident decisions before the playbook gave them the answer?

Try giving your new hire a messy real-world scenario to navigate without the full script. See what choices they make and what questions they ask. That data reveals what they already know and what needs more time to sink in.
