# Design gamification that improves decision quality not points

Most gamification programs celebrate effort, not outcomes. I once joined a learning program where participants earned points for watching videos and taking quizzes, even when they never applied what they learned. The game became the focus, not the growth. If your gamification system rewards points, you need to ask yourself whether it actually drives the behavior you want to encourage.

## Core point

Gamification should highlight decisions, not activities. Points are trivial compared to real improvement. Design systems that surface the quality of choices people make, track whether those choices lead to better results, and reinforce the habits that move the needle. AI can suggest relevant scenarios and track patterns, but the structure must be built around judgment, not clicks.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I worked with, we replaced a quiz-based reward with a system that tracked how managers used feedback in their weekly reviews. The team that consistently applied the feedback saw higher engagement scores and better project outcomes. The focus shifted from earning points to building capability.

When gamification reinforces decision quality, it becomes a tool for growth, not a distraction.
