# Use reflective debriefs after projects to strengthen learning transfer

Projects often end without intentional reflection. Build reflective debriefs into your project lifecycle to strengthen learning transfer and improve team performance. One company structured monthly debriefs where teams discussed what went well, what went wrong, and what they would do differently next time. They also connected project insights to future work. The teams reported better learning retention and more consistent application of lessons learned across projects. The organization also saw improved decision quality and faster adaptation to new challenges.
