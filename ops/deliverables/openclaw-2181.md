  "article_content":"Quality assurance workflows often rely on subjective checklists rather than measurable outcomes. This creates friction where high-value releases get delayed for minor documentation issues. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking checklists, measure outcomes of critical release decisions made by QA engineers. Speed, accuracy and consistency serve as reliable indicators of process maturity. Consider a software release scenario. Did training program help a QA lead approve a release based on critical bug fixes rather than internal politics? Did it reduce regression rates in subsequent versions compared to previous quarters? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good release decision looks like for specific product constraints. Learners receive guidance on how their risk assessments align with those standards. This shift changes how quality demonstrates value. Connecting learning to code stability outcomes proves impact of training on product reliability. By measuring decision quality, QA teams can show that their learning initiatives are a driver of better software performance and customer satisfaction.",
