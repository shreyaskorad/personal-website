# Improve Judgment Without Adding Course Fatigue

People are already drowning in course fatigue. They attend training sessions and immediately forget them because the content doesn't connect to real work. You can improve judgment without more training by creating practice opportunities instead of more content. I've seen leaders attend endless workshops on decision-making yet make worse decisions because they never had a chance to practice applying what they learned.

## Core point
Judgment improves through practice not lectures. When people apply concepts in real situations and get feedback they build decision muscles. Course fatigue happens because learners absorb information without applying it. The solution is to embed learning into daily work where people can experiment and adjust based on real results.

## Practical takeaway
Create short practice sessions before important decisions. Give teams a real problem to solve using the concepts they learned. After they make a decision have them reflect on what worked and what didn't. This mirrors how athletes practice before games instead of just watching videos. The practice builds judgment better than any course ever could.

Your judgment training should feel like practice not another seminar. Real work problems with honest feedback create the kind of learning that sticks long after a workshop ends.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
