  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This creates a disconnect where learners finish modules yet fail to apply knowledge when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a data governance scenario. Did learning program help a data analyst prioritize data quality standards over speed of reporting? Did it reduce compliance errors in quarterly audits? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific data contexts. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Connecting learning decisions to data accuracy outcomes validates investment in training programs. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better software uptime and customer satisfaction.",
