  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. A learner might finish a module but still struggle to apply knowledge when it matters most. This disconnect weakens the business case for learning investments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements? Did it improve the quality of vendor selections compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires clear criteria and a feedback loop. Teams define what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how L&D demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is not just a cost center but a driver of better business outcomes. This approach requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific roles. It involves gathering feedback from stakeholders after decisions are made, not just when training concludes. It shifts focus from learning consumption to learning application. Teams can implement this by identifying three to five critical decision points in a workflow. They track whether learners make decisions that meet predefined criteria. This simple framework turns vague learning goals into measurable business impact.",
