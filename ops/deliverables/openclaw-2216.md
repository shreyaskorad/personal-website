  "article_content":"Gamification programs often prioritize points and badges over actual learning transfer. This creates a disconnect where players complete levels yet fail to apply skills when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking leaderboard scores, measure outcomes of decisions players make during simulation. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of skill application. Consider a compliance training simulation. Did the game help a trainee prioritize safety protocols over speed of task completion? Did it improve consistency of risk assessments compared to previous cohorts? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific regulatory contexts. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with real-world standards. This shift changes how gamification demonstrates value. Connecting simulation decisions to actual job performance validates investment in learning games. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that gamified learning drives better safety outcomes and operational compliance.",
