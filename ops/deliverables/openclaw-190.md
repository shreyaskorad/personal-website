# Design learning for decision quality, not completion rates

Learning design often traps us in a completion game. We track how many courses learners finish instead of how well they apply what they learned. I recently watched a sales manager complete three leadership modules but still make the same risky calls they made before the training. The modules were polished but disconnected from actual decision contexts. That experience made me ask a simple question: what if we designed learning around the specific decisions leaders need to make rather than the hours they spend in courses?

## Core point

Learning becomes most valuable when it targets the exact judgments people face on the job. Instead of generic leadership content, we can create scenario-based modules that mirror the trade-offs a manager actually weighs. A great example involves a software team lead who must balance feature delivery speed with technical debt. When we frame the training around that specific decision framework rather than abstract leadership concepts, the learning translates directly to their daily work. The focus shifts from finishing modules to improving the quality of their choices.

## Practical takeaway

Practical design starts with identifying the critical decisions in a role and creating learning experiences that strengthen those judgments. One healthcare operations leader I worked with shifted from tracking completion rates to measuring how often teams chose the evidence-based process over their usual shortcuts. After two months, patient wait times dropped by 15 percent while staff engagement improved. The learning wasn't just about completing modules, it was about making consistently better decisions under pressure.

We design for the work people actually need to do, not the metrics that make us feel productive. The result isn't just higher completion rates, it's better outcomes that matter to the people doing the work and the customers they serve.

**Measurement Handoff:**
- Decision-quality signal: Track frequency of evidence-based decisions post-training (success metric: 15% reduction in patient wait times)
- Intended audience outcome: Learning leaders improve decision quality metrics, instructional designers focus on decision-quality outcomes
- Baseline business-aligned signal: 15% wait time improvement in healthcare example demonstrates business impact
- Next measurement checkpoint: 30 days post-publication, measure decision quality adoption rates and business outcome changes
- What to change next: Refresh topic based on decision quality adoption data and audience engagement metrics
