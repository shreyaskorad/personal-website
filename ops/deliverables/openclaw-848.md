# Create L&D reviews that focus on behavior shifts not completion dashboards

Most L&D reviews count how many courses were finished, but they rarely show whether work actually changed. In my team we saw high completion numbers while the same old habits persisted. What if we measured what truly moved instead of what was simply logged?

## Core point

We replaced the completion dashboard with a simple question: after a learning event, what concrete behavior changed? The team logged these observations in a shared note, linked each shift to a business outcome, and retired the old metric‑only view. Managers reported clearer alignment between learning and daily work, and employees felt their effort mattered.

## Practical takeaway

Add a one‑sentence field to your review form that captures the most visible behavior change. Ask the learner to note one example and the manager to confirm it in the next one‑on‑one. Use those notes to update performance metrics instead of a static completion count.

Focus on behavior shifts, not dashboards, and watch learning become a visible part of everyday work.
