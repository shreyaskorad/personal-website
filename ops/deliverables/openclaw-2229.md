  "article_content":"Sales coaching programs often prioritize seat time over actual deal impact. This creates a disconnect where reps finish training yet fail to apply techniques when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking session duration, measure outcomes of pipeline decisions reps make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a negotiation scenario. Did learning program help a sales rep discount a deal based on value creation criteria rather than internal pressure? Did it improve consistency of territory allocation compared to previous quarters? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific market contexts. Reps receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to revenue targets that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that coaching is a driver of better win rates and margin protection.",
