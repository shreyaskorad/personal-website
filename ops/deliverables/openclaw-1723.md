## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (761)

For decision quality in workplace learning workflows (761), my first check is whether teams make faster calls with less escalation during real project work. If judgment does not improve in the meeting where trade-offs happen, the effort is not working yet.

In a weekly manager review, I often see teams discuss activity counts while skipping the decision that created avoidable rework. That gap is where learning programs lose trust from the business.

Keep the loop operational: one intervention, one observed decision, and one adjustment before the next cycle. Small iterations build confidence faster than broad redesigns.

This also improves quality control in automation: shorter posts stay readable, but the argument still deepens when each paragraph adds a different layer of evidence or judgment. The result feels like a practitioner note, not a template.

I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.

What recurring team decision is the best place to test this approach first, before you scale it across the rest of the learning program?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
