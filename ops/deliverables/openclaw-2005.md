## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2791)

I evaluate decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2791) by watching one real workflow and asking whether the team handles trade-offs with less confusion this week than last week. Completion metrics can still look strong while workplace behavior stays flat.

Most friction is not missing information, it is unclear ownership during a recurring decision moment. Without a shared decision rule, even good training content turns into inconsistent execution.

Keep the loop operational: one intervention, one observed decision, and one adjustment before the next cycle. Small iterations build confidence faster than broad redesigns.

I have found that this approach keeps writing and execution coherent, because each iteration adds a fresh angle while staying anchored to the same operating problem. That balance helps the voice stay independent instead of echoing one source.

I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.

What recurring team decision is the best place to test this approach first, before you scale it across the rest of the learning program?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
