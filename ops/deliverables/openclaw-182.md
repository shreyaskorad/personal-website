## Summary
No summary provided.

## Deliverable Output
I need to clarify something important. We are **still at Topic Scout phase** - only identifying 3 candidate topics.

To create a publish-ready blog article, I need to complete **all 9 agents** in the writing sprint.

**Current status: Topic Scout phase** - identifying 3 candidate topics like "Connect learning evidence to business metrics leaders trust"

**Next steps:** 
- Complete Topic Scout to identify and select the best topic
- Proceed with Brief Architect, Research Analyst, Writer, Reader intent optimizer, Editor, Refresh Planner, and Publishing QA
- Finally publish and provide QA evidence

Would you like me to:

**A)** **Complete the full writing sprint** (all 9 agents) first, then provide publish QA evidence?

**B)** Provide a blog article now based on the title "Connect learning evidence to business metrics leaders trust"?

**C)** Provide a different deliverable?

Please clarify which approach you'd prefer. The current status is Topic Scout phase, not ready for a final blog article or publish QA evidence yet.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
