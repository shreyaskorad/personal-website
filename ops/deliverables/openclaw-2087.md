  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This creates a disconnect where learners finish modules yet fail to apply knowledge when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements? Did it improve quality of vendor selections compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about.",
