**Decision-Making Framework**:

**When to Prioritize Phase 1 (Quick Wins)**:
- When immediate improvement is desired with minimal investment
- To build momentum and experience success
- When time constraints limit larger projects
- When budget is tight and requires flexibility
- To address obvious, high-impact issues quickly

**When to Defer to Phase 2 (Medium Projects)**:
- When moderate investment is needed
- When functionality improves significantly
- When better planning and coordination are required
- When current energy levels are adequate for sustained effort
- When budget allows for phased approach

**When to Plan for Phase 3 (Major Investments)**:
- When significant changes require substantial resources
- When specialized skills or professional help is needed
- When long-term benefits justify the investment
- When other changes are complete and functional
- When more time is available for planning and execution

**Resource Optimization Strategies**:

**Cost-Saving Approaches**:
- [ ] DIY for simple tasks, professional for complex work
- [ ] Purchase during sales and promotions
- [ ] Shop multiple vendors for best prices
- [ ] Reuse materials where possible
- [ ] Prioritize spending on high-impact areas
- [ ] Consider refurbished or gently used items

**Time-Saving Approaches**:
- [ ] Plan complete projects at once when possible
- [ ] Combine related tasks to reduce setup/cleanup
- [ ] Work on multiple phases simultaneously when practical
- [ ] Schedule improvement sessions back-to-back
- [ ] Delegate when appropriate (family members)

**Quality Optimization**:
- [ ] Research thoroughly before purchasing
- [ ] Follow manufacturer instructions precisely
- [ ] Invest in quality materials for high-wear areas
- [ ] Leave adequate time for proper application
- [ ] Document process for future reference

## Decisions and Assumptions

**Decision 1: Phased Approach**
The home improvement process follows three distinct phases rather than attempting to complete all changes simultaneously. This approach acknowledges resource constraints and builds momentum progressively.

**Decision 2: Prioritization by Impact**
Changes are selected based on immediate quality of life impact rather than aesthetic appeal alone. Functional improvements and quick wins receive priority.

**Decision 3: Resource-Based Flexibility**
The timeline and budget allocation are flexible based on actual circumstances. Phases can be compressed, expanded, or reordered based on availability and circumstances.

**Decision 4: Time Block Allocation**
Dedicated weekly time blocks (3-4 hours per week) provide consistent progress without overwhelming the schedule. This approach maintains consistency over longer periods.

**Decision 5: Continuous Improvement**
The process includes regular review and adjustment based on actual progress, challenges encountered, and available resources. No single plan is rigid or unchangeable.

**Assumptions**:
- User has access to basic tools and materials for Phase 1 changes
- User can allocate 3-4 hours per week for improvement work
- Lighting and surface improvements are within current budget
- Professional assistance can be arranged when needed for Phase 2+ work
- Changes will be evaluated on actual impact rather than initial appeal
- Home improvement can be a gradual, sustainable process
