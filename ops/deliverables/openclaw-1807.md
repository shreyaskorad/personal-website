  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This approach creates a disconnect between learner activity and organizational value. A learner might finish a compliance module quickly yet still struggle to apply knowledge during critical moments. Decision quality metrics address this gap by shifting focus from inputs to outcomes. Instead of tracking seat time, measure the quality of decisions made using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program enable a hiring manager to select the best candidate based on defined role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and establishing a feedback loop. Teams define criteria and learners receive guidance on alignment. This shift changes how learning and development demonstrates value to the business. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better business outcomes rather than just a cost center.",
