## Why This Matters
Most teams talk about Create and publish one high-quality blog post for growth in L&D, gamification, data, LXD, and AI at the idea level, but results come from execution quality. The real gain appears when the workflow is designed for speed, feedback, and measurable outcomes.

## Metrics To Track
- Capture-to-deliverable turnaround time
- Number of tasks moved to review with real artifacts
- Rework rate after review feedback
- Queue age for high-priority tasks

## Closing
