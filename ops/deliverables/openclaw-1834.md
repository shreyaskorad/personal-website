## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (1879)

I evaluate decision quality in workplace learning workflows (1879) by watching one real workflow and asking whether the team handles trade-offs with less confusion this week than last week. Completion metrics can still look strong while workplace behavior stays flat.

A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.

Keep the loop operational: one intervention, one observed decision, and one adjustment before the next cycle. Small iterations build confidence faster than broad redesigns.

I have found that this approach keeps writing and execution coherent, because each iteration adds a fresh angle while staying anchored to the same operating problem. That balance helps the voice stay independent instead of echoing one source.

The writing quality also improves when each paragraph contributes a distinct layer, such as context, tension, choice, and reflection. That structure reduces repetition and keeps the voice clear without sounding mechanical.

What recurring team decision is the best place to test this approach first, before you scale it across the rest of the learning program?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
