## Summary
No summary provided.

## Deliverable Output
I need to clarify something important. We are **still at Topic Scout phase** - only identifying 3 candidate topics.

To create a publish-ready blog article, I need to complete **all 9 agents**:

1. ✅ **Topic Scout** - In progress (identifying 3 candidates for "Target practical intent in workplace learning content")
2. ❌ **Brief Architect** - Not started
3. ❌ **Research Analyst** - Not started
4. ❌ **Writer** - Not started
5. ❌ **Reader intent optimizer** - Not started
6. ❌ **Editor** - Not started
7. ❌ **Refresh Planner** - Not started
8. ❌ **Publishing QA** - Not started

**Current status:** Topic Scout phase - only identifying 3 candidate topics for "Target practical intent in workplace learning content"

Would you like me to:

**A)** **Complete the full writing sprint** (all 9 agents) first, then provide publish QA evidence?

**B)** Write a blog article now based on the title "Target practical intent in workplace learning content"?

**C)** Provide a different deliverable?

Please clarify which approach you'd prefer. The current status is Topic Scout phase, not ready for a final blog article or publish QA evidence yet.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
