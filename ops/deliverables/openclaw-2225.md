  "article_content":"Sales coaching programs often prioritize method completion over actual deal impact. This creates a disconnect where sellers finish training yet fail to qualify opportunities when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time in workshops, measure outcomes of real-time pipeline decisions. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of revenue performance. Consider a deal qualification scenario. Did learning program help a sales rep choose between a qualified prospect and a long shot based on budget constraints? Did it improve consistency of pricing strategy compared to previous quarters? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good sales decision looks like for specific market contexts. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational revenue targets that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that coaching is a driver of better win rates and margin protection.",
