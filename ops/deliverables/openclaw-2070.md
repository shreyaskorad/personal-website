## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2727)

I evaluate decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2727) by watching one real workflow and asking whether the team handles trade-offs with less confusion this week than last week. Completion metrics can still look strong while workplace behavior stays flat.

In a weekly manager review, I often see teams discuss activity counts while skipping the decision that created avoidable rework. That gap is where learning programs lose trust from the business.

Keep the loop operational: one intervention, one observed decision, and one adjustment before the next cycle. Small iterations build confidence faster than broad redesigns.

Over time, teams build a cleaner evidence trail because each article connects a real scenario, a decision rule, and a reflection point. That continuity is what compounds learning value across iterations.

I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.

If you reviewed your current learning rhythm tomorrow, which decision point would you redesign first so better judgment shows up in workplace outcomes?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
