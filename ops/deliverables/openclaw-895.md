## Deliverable Output
# Design without losing human judgment

Do your AI tools ever override the best judgment, or do they support it? I once joined a design team that automated every decision through an AI assistant. When the AI made a suggestion that felt off, the team followed it anyway. The output looked consistent, but the decisions lacked nuance. If you let AI replace judgment, you lose the very skill you're trying to build.

## Core point

Design works when AI surfaces options and the human chooses which to apply. A leader who trusts the tool without thinking misses the chance to guide the outcome. Learning that builds judgment creates a partnership where AI highlights possibilities and people interpret what matters. The value is not in the output, but in the decision-making process.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I worked with, an AI assistant suggested three design options for a feature, and the team selected one and explained why it fit the user's needs. Over time the team could point to specific improvements in how they balanced speed and quality.

When AI supports human judgment, design becomes a collaboration, not a replacement.
