  "article_content":"Hiring teams often prioritize speed to fill roles quickly. This can lead to poor long-term fits. A candidate might move fast through the pipeline but lack the skills needed for the specific job constraints. Decision quality metrics solve this issue. Instead of measuring time-to-hire, evaluate the outcomes of selections over time. Speed, accuracy, and confidence serve as reliable indicators of good hiring. Did the hiring manager identify the best candidate based on actual role requirements? Did the new hire succeed in the role after six months? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific roles. Teams provide guidance to hiring managers on how their choices align with those standards. This shift connects learning directly to retention rates and diversity goals, metrics that hiring leaders care about most. By focusing on decision quality, L&D can ensure that training programs contribute to better hires rather than just faster hires.",
