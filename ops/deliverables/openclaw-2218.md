  "article_content":"Strategic decision making often relies on gut feeling or incomplete data. This leads to vendor selection errors or unnecessary risk exposure. Simulated scenarios solve this by letting leaders practice high-stakes choices in a safe environment. This approach applies gamification principles to critical business workflows. Consider a vendor selection scenario. Instead of reviewing a slide deck, procurement teams play a negotiation simulation game. They score vendors based on cost, risk, and quality criteria defined by stakeholders. This turns an abstract process into a concrete learning experience. It reduces decision fatigue and overconfidence by providing a sandbox for testing assumptions. Using lightweight games for strategic training bridges the gap between theory and practice without the overhead of expensive real-world simulations. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that gamified simulations improve decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about.",
