# Use AI to personalize learning journeys

Do your learning programs treat everyone the same, or do they adapt to how people learn? I once joined a company where everyone took the same onboarding course, even though some people needed more practice and others were ready to move fast. The result was boredom for some and frustration for others. A program that doesn't adapt loses the people who are in the middle.

## Core point

AI can personalize learning by surfacing the right content at the right time based on engagement and performance. A coach who ignores differences in learning speed misses the chance to help everyone grow. Learning design that uses data to adjust difficulty and pacing creates a path that fits each person. AI can recommend next steps, but the leader must interpret the signals and provide guidance.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I worked with, an AI assistant suggested tailored exercises after each module, and a manager reviewed progress every two weeks. The person who struggled got more practice, while the person who moved quickly saw new challenges. Everyone finished on time, and the team could point to specific skills they built.

When learning adjusts to the learner, it becomes a tool that grows with people instead of pushing them through the same steps. Start with one module that adapts, then expand the approach.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
