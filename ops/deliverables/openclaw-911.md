# Design learning prompts that improve decisions during real project pressure

Do your prompts actually help people decide, or do they just slow them down? I once tried to coach a team through a complex problem using a generic prompt. The team got stuck debating the wording instead of solving the problem. We realized that prompts need to reflect urgency and constraint. Reflective question: Do your prompts surface good decisions, or just good wording?

## Core point

Effective prompts tie directly to the decision you want to make right now. Start by stating the context and constraint, then ask for evaluation instead of explanation. Over time, these prompts become a mental framework that keeps you grounded when pressure rises. AI can surface relevant examples and highlight patterns, but the value comes from your own thinking.

## Practical takeaway

In a weekly planning session, a team used a one-question template: what is one decision you will make differently this week? The answers appeared in a shared doc, and an AI assistant flagged recurring patterns. Over time the team improved its approach to trade-offs and reduced unplanned rework.

When prompts match real pressure, they guide, not hinder. Start with one focused question and let the habit build. The team that practices this pattern over time will make better decisions under time pressure and feel less overwhelmed.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
