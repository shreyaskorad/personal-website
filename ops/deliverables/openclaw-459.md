# Coach Managers to Run Better Learning Conversations in Weekly One-on-Ones

Weekly one-on-ones often devolve into status updates and problem-solving sessions instead of genuine learning conversations. Managers focus on what's not working without pausing to explore what's working. I've sat in countless meetings where the manager asks a laundry list of questions and the employee just answers yes or no without any reflection.

## Core point

Learning conversations require structure and curiosity. Managers should design their one-on-ones around three questions that surface insight and growth. The conversation becomes a genuine exploration instead of a performance review.

## Practical takeaway

Structure each one-on-one around three questions. Start with what went well last week. Then ask what challenges you faced and how you overcame them. End with what you're planning to tackle next week and what you need help with. This simple framework forces managers to be curious about both wins and struggles.

Your one-on-ones will feel different when you prioritize learning over status updates. The conversations become richer because you're asking about growth not just output.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
