## Deliverable Output
# Design learning prompts that improve decisions during real project pressure

Decision quality drops under pressure but structured prompts maintain clarity when the clock ticks.

## Core point

I've noticed teams crumble when working memory fills with urgent details. The pressure forces vague decisions instead of calculated ones. You can prevent this by building prompt libraries before your next crisis. The structure gives your team a safety net when the stakes feel highest.

## Practical takeaway

Picture your project manager deciding on a scope change while a deadline looms. With a pre-built prompt template they can ask three specific questions about tradeoffs, risk levels, and alternative approaches instead of guessing. They already have the structure they need to make a clear decision. This same approach works for budget approvals, client feedback, or technical tradeoffs.

How would your team handle a stakeholder conflict that needs resolution within hours?

Closing with structured questions, not vague intentions, keeps decision quality high even when the pressure mounts.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
