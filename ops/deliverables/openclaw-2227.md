  "article_content":"Data governance workflows often prioritize completion checklists over actual impact. This disconnect prevents learners from validating critical fixes when it matters most. Decision quality metrics address this gap by focusing on outcomes of data decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a data integrity scenario. Did learning program help a data analyst prioritize data quality standards over reporting speed? Did it improve consistency of deployment decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific data contexts. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Connecting learning decisions to data stability outcomes validates investment in training programs. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better software uptime and customer satisfaction.",
