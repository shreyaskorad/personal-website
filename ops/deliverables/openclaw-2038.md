  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This creates a disconnect where learners finish modules yet fail to apply knowledge when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of vendor selections compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Teams define criteria and provide feedback to learners on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better business outcomes.",
