# Coach managers to run better learning conversations in weekly one-on-ones

Do your weekly one-on-ones actually improve how people learn, or do they become routine check-ins? I once joined a team where the manager asked about projects but never about learning. The conversations felt transactional, and nobody could point to a single change the employee made because of the session. That experience taught me that conversations without a focus on learning miss the point.

## Core point

Coaching conversations become learning opportunities when you surface specific challenges and guide the person through a decision. A manager who only asks about progress misses the chance to help someone grow. Learning design that emphasizes judgment turns one-on-ones into practice fields where mistakes are safe and feedback is immediate. AI can suggest relevant questions and highlight patterns, but the leader must interpret the signals and coach the person.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I worked with, managers added a one-minute check at the end of each one-on-one: what did you learn from the conversation, and what will you apply next week? The answers appeared in the shared doc, and an AI assistant flagged recurring themes. Over six months the team could point to specific improvements in how managers supported learning.

If you structure one-on-ones to surface learning, they become a powerful habit that builds capability over time.
