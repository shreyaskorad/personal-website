  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This creates a disconnect between learner activity and organizational value. A learner might finish a module but still struggle to apply knowledge when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time or course progress, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy, and confidence serve as reliable indicators of knowledge transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning intervention help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Teams establish criteria and provide feedback to learners on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better business outcomes rather than just a cost center. This approach requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific roles and contexts. It involves gathering feedback from stakeholders after decisions are made, not just when training concludes. It shifts focus from learning consumption to learning application. Teams can implement this by identifying three to five critical decision points in a workflow. They track whether learners make decisions that meet predefined criteria. This simple framework turns vague learning goals into measurable business impact.",
