## Deliverable Output
# Make learning evidence useful for business reviews without heavy reporting overhead

Business reviews often overwhelm teams with data without revealing the learning value. One company redesigned their review process to focus on what people learned and applied. They asked what new skills were used and how decisions improved. The review team also highlighted which learning investments drove the most capability growth. Managers used these insights to prioritize future development and to communicate learning impact to stakeholders. The review process became shorter, clearer, and far more useful for decision making.
