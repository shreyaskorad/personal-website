# Build feedback rituals that convert learning into visible team behavior

Do your teams learn from feedback, or do they ignore it? I once joined a team that celebrated high ratings without asking what the feedback meant. The feedback sat in a spreadsheet, never to be seen again. When I asked the team what they would change, they had no answers. That experience taught me that feedback only matters if it leads to visible change.

## Core point

Feedback rituals work when the conversation connects to concrete actions, not vague praise. A manager who only says good job misses the chance to highlight a specific behavior that could improve. AI can surface patterns and suggest next steps, but the leader must interpret the data and commit to a clear change.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I worked with, each sprint ended with a two-question review: what feedback did we receive, and what will we do differently next sprint? The answers appeared in the shared doc, and an AI assistant highlighted recurring themes. Over six months the team reduced rework and improved communication without adding more training.

When feedback becomes part of the daily rhythm, it transforms from a one-time comment into a habit that shapes how the team works.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
