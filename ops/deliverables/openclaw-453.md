# Help Cross-Functional Teams Learn Faster Through Shared Project Work

Cross-functional teams often struggle to learn from each other because everyone focuses on their own domain instead of the project as a whole. You end up with siloed knowledge where designers, engineers, and product managers each develop expertise in isolation. The team moves forward but no one actually integrates what they learned.

## Core point
Projects become learning opportunities when you structure them explicitly to surface insights across disciplines. Instead of asking people to work together on a deliverable you design projects that force collaboration and reflection. Each team member brings their expertise to a shared challenge and the team discovers solutions that no single person could have invented alone.

## Practical takeaway
Create project retrospectives where every role presents what they learned about the project and about each other's work. Ask engineers to explain technical decisions to designers and ask designers to explain user needs to engineers. After each major milestone, have the team identify three insights that cross their disciplinary boundaries. These conversations build a shared mental model that accelerates future collaboration.

Projects with explicit learning components produce teams that solve problems faster because they see the system holistically instead of through isolated lenses.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
