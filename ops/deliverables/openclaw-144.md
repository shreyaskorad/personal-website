## Why This Matters

## A Practical Approach
Start by defining one clear objective for Autonomous SEO blog sprint: LXD real-world case analysis with mistakes, fixes, and ROI framing.

- Number of tasks moved to review with real artifacts
- Rework rate after review feedback
- Queue age for high-priority tasks
