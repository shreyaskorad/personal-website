  "deliverable": "# Use reflective debriefs after projects to strengthen learning transfer\n\nProjects often end without capturing what actually worked. Teams move to the next task without stopping to reflect. This misses the chance to turn experience into knowledge. Learning remains trapped in individual heads. The team does not benefit from shared insights.\n\nReflective debriefs change this pattern. They force teams to slow down and think. After a project concludes, you ask what decisions made sense and what did not. You explore trade-offs and constraints. You surface assumptions. This turns messy experience into clear lessons.\n\nI led a product team that struggled to improve our launch process. We blamed vague factors like \"market timing.\" A retrospective session revealed we always pushed deadlines when stakeholder questions increased. This insight came only because we stopped and talked. We adjusted our process after that conversation.\n\nWhat would your team discover if you asked these questions at the end of every project?\n\nSchedule thirty minutes after each major milestone. Ask what surprised you. Ask what you would do differently next time. Document the answers. Share them with the wider team. Review them before starting the next project. This creates a learning loop that prevents repeated mistakes.\n\n1. ATD research on learning transfer: https://www.td.org/research\n2.
