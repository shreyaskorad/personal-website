**MEASUREMENT HANDOFF**

Decision-quality signal: Practical framework with concrete template and measurable approach (12% performance improvement claim with citation support from leadership development study).
Intended audience outcome: Managers increase coaching frequency from ad-hoc to weekly structured check-ins using simple metrics; catch knowledge gaps before they become blockers; ensure coaching leads to concrete changes.
Baseline business-aligned signal: Expected 12% improvement in team performance per leadership development meta-analysis; measurable increase in weekly check-in frequency; concrete tracking of coaching effectiveness.
Next measurement checkpoint: Track coaching frequency improvement over 90 days, collect manager feedback on template usability, measure any observed changes in team performance metrics; update refresh plan based on results.
