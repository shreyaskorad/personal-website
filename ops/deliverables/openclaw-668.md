## Deliverable Output
# Build a practical LxD workflow for small teams shipping weekly

Small teams cannot run full scale learning design processes effectively. A practical workflow focuses on rapid iteration and team ownership instead. One company started with weekly two-hour design sessions where teams identified one learning need and shipped a solution in that same week. They also created a simple template that made planning fast and easy. The teams completed more projects and felt more ownership of their learning initiatives. The organization also reduced approval overhead and improved learning impact.
