  "article_content":"Workplace learning often prioritizes seat time over actual impact. Static courses fail to address the nuance of real-time decision making. AI-powered adaptive learning solves this by generating dynamic scenarios. Instead of generic modules, learners face simulations tailored to their role and context. This approach improves decision quality in the moment of need. Consider a sales coaching scenario. A static training module might teach objection handling. An AI-driven simulation can present a customer who raises a specific, nuanced objection based on the learner's actual past interactions. This context shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Connecting learning to revenue outcomes proves impact. By measuring decision quality, teams can justify the investment in AI tools.",
