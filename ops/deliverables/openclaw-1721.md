## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (763)

For decision quality in workplace learning workflows (763), my first check is whether teams make faster calls with less escalation during real project work. If judgment does not improve in the meeting where trade-offs happen, the effort is not working yet.

A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.

Keep the loop operational: one intervention, one observed decision, and one adjustment before the next cycle. Small iterations build confidence faster than broad redesigns.

Over time, teams build a cleaner evidence trail because each article connects a real scenario, a decision rule, and a reflection point. That continuity is what compounds learning value across iterations.

I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.

Where in your next manager check-in could you replace activity updates with a sharper conversation about decision quality?
