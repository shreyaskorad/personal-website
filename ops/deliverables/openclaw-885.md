## Deliverable Output
# Turn weekly planning into learning loops

Do your planning sessions actually build capability, or do they just assign tasks? I once joined a team that treated planning as a checklist exercise with no space for reflection. When I asked the team what they learned, they had no answers. The meetings were efficient, but the team never discussed decisions or trade-offs.

## Core point

Weekly planning becomes a learning opportunity when you surface questions that provoke thinking about the work. A leader who only assigns tasks misses the chance to explore how to improve outcomes. Learning design that focuses on decision quality turns routine meetings into growth moments. AI can suggest relevant scenarios and highlight patterns, but the real value comes from the team’s own reasoning.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I added a one-question template to each planning session: what is one decision you will make differently this week? The answers appeared in the shared doc, and an AI assistant flagged recurring themes. Over six months the team improved its approach to trade-offs and reduced rework.

If you design planning as a learning ritual, the team grows without extra courses. Start with one question, keep it short, and let the habit build over time.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
