  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. A learner might finish a module quickly yet still struggle to apply knowledge during critical moments. This disconnect weakens the business case for learning investments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time or course progress, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires clear criteria and a feedback loop. Teams define criteria and provide feedback to learners on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about.",
