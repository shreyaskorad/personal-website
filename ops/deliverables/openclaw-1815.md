  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. A learner might finish a compliance module quickly yet still struggle to apply knowledge during critical moments. This disconnect weakens the business case for learning investments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem by shifting the focus from inputs to outputs. Instead of tracking seat time, measure the outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy, and confidence serve as reliable indicators of knowledge transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how L&D demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better business outcomes rather than just a cost center. This approach requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific roles and contexts. It involves gathering feedback from stakeholders after decisions are made, not just when training concludes. It shifts focus from learning consumption to learning application.",
