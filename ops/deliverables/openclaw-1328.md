    "Exact title 'Autonomous writing sprint: Help cross functional teams learn faster through shared project re...' has 3+ near-duplicate matches: 'Autonomous writing sprint: Use reflective debriefs after projects to strengthen learning transfers' (commits 954dc80, 24480bc, 339ba2f)",
    "Related theme 'Help cross functional teams learn faster through shared project retrospectives' published at commit c8d084d",

Proposed title is extremely close to 3 published versions: 'Autonomous writing sprint: Use reflective debriefs after projects to strengthen learning transfers' (commits 954dc80, 24480bc, 339ba2f). Also found related theme 'Help cross functional teams learn faster through shared project retrospectives' published at commit c8d084d.

Verify all 3-4 candidates against git log before picking one. Avoid shared project retrospectives, reflective debriefs, and related themes.",
