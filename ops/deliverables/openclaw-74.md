# Weekly Schedule & Execution Template Plan

## Objective
Create a practical weekly schedule and execution template that clarifies the scope, structure, and workflow of task management. This template provides clarity on how to structure weekly planning, prioritize tasks, track execution, and review progress systematically.

## Weekly/Daily Template

### Weekly Schedule Overview
- **Monday**: Planning Day - Review objectives, set priorities, outline weekly work
- **Tuesday-Friday**: Execution Day - Deep work blocks, meetings, task completion
- **Saturday**: Review Day - Evaluate weekly progress, adjust next week's plan
- **Sunday**: Rest & Reset - Recharge, prepare for upcoming week

### Daily Execution Template
```
Morning Block (9:00-12:00):
├── Highest priority deep work
├── Notification-free time
└── Focus on 1-3 critical tasks

Afternoon Block (14:00-17:00):
├── Meetings and collaboration
├── Administrative work
└── Response-heavy tasks

Evening Block (19:00-21:00):
├── Weekly review
├── Planning next day
└── Personal recharge
```

### Weekly Task Distribution
- **Critical tasks**: 20-30% of weekly volume
- **Important but not urgent**: 40-50%
- **Admin/low priority**: 20-30%
- **Buffer time**: 10%

## Prioritization Rules

### Eisenhower Matrix Application
```
Q1: Important & Urgent → Do First
Q2: Important & Not Urgent → Schedule
Q3: Not Important & Urgent → Delegate
Q4: Not Important & Not Urgent → Eliminate
```

### Priority Ranking System
1. **Impacts external stakeholders** (highest)
2. **Blocks critical path** (high)
3. **Depends on others** (medium)
4. **Routine maintenance** (low)

### Resource Availability Check
Before prioritizing, verify:
- Time availability (hours per day)
- Energy levels (deep work windows)
- Dependencies required
- Technical/permission barriers

## Tracking Method

### Task Entry Format
```
[TASK_ID] [PRIORITY] [DUE_DATE] [ESTIMATED_HOURS] [ACTUAL_HOURS] [STATUS]

Example:
WK01-HIGH-2026-02-23-2.0-2.5-IN_PROGRESS
```

### Progress Tracking Checklist
- [ ] Started task
- [ ] Made meaningful progress (>30%)
- [ ] Completed milestone
