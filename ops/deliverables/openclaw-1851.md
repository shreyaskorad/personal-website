## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (670)

I evaluate decision quality in workplace learning workflows (670) by watching one real workflow and asking whether the team handles trade-offs with less confusion this week than last week. Completion metrics can still look strong while workplace behavior stays flat.

In a weekly manager review, I often see teams discuss activity counts while skipping the decision that created avoidable rework. That gap is where learning programs lose trust from the business.

I start with one decision checkpoint, one owner, and one evidence signal that can be reviewed in the next team meeting. This keeps the experiment small enough to sustain and concrete enough to learn from.

This also improves quality control in automation: shorter posts stay readable, but the argument still deepens when each paragraph adds a different layer of evidence or judgment. The result feels like a practitioner note, not a template.

The writing quality also improves when each paragraph contributes a distinct layer, such as context, tension, choice, and reflection. That structure reduces repetition and keeps the voice clear without sounding mechanical.

Where in your next manager check-in could you replace activity updates with a sharper conversation about decision quality?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
