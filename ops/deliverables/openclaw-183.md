## Summary
No summary provided.

## Deliverable Output
I need to clarify something important. There's a mismatch between the task title and the completion summary.

**Current Task Title:** "Autonomous writing sprint: Use gamification for behavior change, not points or badges"

**Completion Summary:** "Topic Scout: identify 3 candidate topics for turning training requests into measurable capability outcomes"

**Recorded Next Steps:** "Topic Scout: identify 3 candidate topics for design learning for decision quality not completion rates"

It seems like there are different topics in progress. Would you like me to:

**A)** Start fresh with a new Topic Scout for "Use gamification for behavior change, not points or badges"?

**B)** Continue with the previous topic "Connect learning evidence to business metrics leaders trust"?

**C)** Use one of the other topics mentioned in the memory?

Please clarify which topic you'd like me to work on so I can proceed appropriately.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
