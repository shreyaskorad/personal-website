## Deliverable Output
# LxD reviews focused on behavior shifts not completion dashboards

Most LxD leaders track course completion rates, but those numbers miss what actually matters. One software company shifted their review process to focus on behavior changes managers demonstrated after training. Within a year their product quality metrics improved and teams reported faster adoption of new processes.

## Core point

Design reviews that surface specific behaviors you want to see, not just completion checkboxes. A healthcare organization created review prompts like describe one instance where a leader applied new communication techniques to resolve conflict during quarterly check-ins. The new system identified top performers and accelerated learning transfer across the organization.

## Practical takeaway

What would make your LxD reviews surface the behaviors that actually drive business results?

Build reviews that measure learning transfer, not just training participation. Teams that evaluate behavior shifts see better long-term impact than those that chase completion statistics alone. LxD leaders should focus on decisions managers make and how learning actually transforms their work, not just which courses they finished.
