# Build a practical LxD workflow for small teams shipping weekly

Small teams ship better learning when they own the entire LxD process from start to finish. A three-person product team redesigned their approach to ship learning weekly. They started with small defined sprints and let the team own every step from concept to delivery. Their first month produced more valuable learning than their previous year of planning.

## Core point

Small teams ship better learning when they own the entire LxD process from start to finish. A three-person product team redesigned their approach to ship learning weekly. They started with small defined sprints and let the team own every step from concept to delivery. Their first month produced more valuable learning than their previous year of planning.

## Practical takeaway

What single constraint is slowing your LxD team down? Remove it to increase delivery speed. Let the team build their own process instead of imposing external frameworks. Measure success by what ships, not by how many hours you spend planning.

Teams that own their LxD process build more valuable learning experiences through rapid iteration and reduced overhead. Small sprints with clear ownership create better outcomes than large, committee-driven initiatives. Your team needs autonomy, not more process.
