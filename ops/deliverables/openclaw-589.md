## Deliverable Output
# Design manager enablement that links coaching actions to team capability growth

Manager enablement programs often separate coaching development from team capability building. One software company redesigned their approach to link every coaching session directly to measurable team capability growth. Their engineering teams showed faster skill adoption and better cross-functional collaboration, proving that integrated enablement produces better business results than siloed programs.

## Core point

Connect coaching actions to team capability goals, not individual coaching skills. A retail chain implemented manager enablement that tracked coaching conversations against capability-building goals like communication skills, conflict resolution, and technical problem solving. The new system increased team performance metrics and reduced turnover by helping managers apply coaching directly to team outcomes.

## Practical takeaway

What would make your manager enablement program directly strengthen team capabilities rather than just coach skill development?

Design enablement that ties coaching conversations to team capability outcomes, not coach performance. Teams that build capability through focused coaching see better long-term results than those that treat coaching as separate from team development. The best programs align coaching development with the capabilities that drive your most critical business outcomes.
