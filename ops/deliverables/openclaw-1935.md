  "article_content":"Hiring teams often prioritize speed-to-fill over finding the best fit. This creates a disconnect where candidates complete the process yet the hire is a mismatch. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking days-to-fill, measure outcomes of the actual hiring decisions learners make. Speed, accuracy, and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the training help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements? Did it reduce the rate of bad hires compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific roles and contexts. Teams define what good looks like and provide feedback on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to retention metrics that stakeholders actually care about.",
