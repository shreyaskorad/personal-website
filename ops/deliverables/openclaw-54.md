## Decisions and Assumptions

**Decision 1: 2-3 Outings Per Week**
The framework targets 2-3 outings per week as a sustainable baseline. Fewer outings may not provide sufficient developmental benefits or socialization, while more outings may create excessive fatigue and overwhelm for both child and parents.

**Decision 2: Mix of Outdoor and Indoor Activities**
Combining outdoor activities with indoor options ensures consistency regardless of weather or energy levels. Outdoor activities provide development benefits and fresh air, while indoor options offer climate control and structured activities.

**Decision 3: Flexible Duration**
Outings vary from 30-minute quick visits to 3-hour extended outings based on child's energy and family's schedule. This flexibility prevents frustration from inflexible schedules and accommodates changing circumstances.

**Decision 4: "Get Out" Priority Over "Plan Perfect"**
Emphasis is placed on getting out of the house rather than creating elaborate, perfect outings. Simple activities with regular implementation provide greater value than occasional elaborate events. This approach reduces stress and increases consistency.

**Decision 5: Build on Existing Plans**
The birthday outing celebration serves as a starting point for establishing regular outing habits, building momentum and creating a foundation for ongoing family outdoor time.

**Assumptions**:
- 1-year-old's schedule can accommodate regular outings with proper preparation
- Family has access to safe outdoor spaces and family-friendly venues
- Weather patterns allow for regular outdoor activities
