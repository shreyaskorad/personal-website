  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. A learner might finish a compliance module yet still struggle to apply knowledge when it matters most. This disconnect weakens the business case for learning investments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem. Instead of tracking seat time or course progress, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a project management scenario. Did the learning program help a team lead choose between strategies based on data rather than intuition? Did it improve the quality of resource allocation decisions compared to previous quarters? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Teams establish criteria and provide feedback to learners on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is a driver of better business outcomes rather than just a cost center.",
