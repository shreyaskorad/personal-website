# Deliverable Draft: Essentially Is It Has All The Calls That I Do

## Objective
Stabilize `Essentially is it has all the calls that I do` through a repeatable integration checklist.

## Checklist
1. Verify credentials and endpoint reachability.

3. Run test event and inspect normalized output.
4. Confirm retry behavior and failure alerts.
5. Record runbook notes and ownership.

## Validation Output
- Connection status: to be verified during execution.
- Data integrity checks: required before marking complete.
- Escalation path: define explicit fallback owner and action.

## Notes
Merged into Fireflies client-call workflow implementation task.

## Next Step
