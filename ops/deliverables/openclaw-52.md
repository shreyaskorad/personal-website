**Project Planning Framework**:

**1. Scope Clarification Phase**
   - Document specific project requirements and boundaries
   - Identify included and excluded elements
   - Define quality standards and acceptance criteria
   - Clarify timing expectations and deliverables
   - Document assumptions and constraints

**2. Feasibility Assessment Phase**
   - Technical: What skills, equipment, and tools are required?
   - Financial: What are the total costs including labor, materials, and contingencies?
   - Time: What timeline is realistic given availability and complexity?
   - Resource: What human and material resources are needed?

**3. Resource Planning Phase**
   - Personnel: Who needs to be involved (DIY vs. professional)?
   - Materials: What specific materials are required with specifications?
   - Equipment: What tools or equipment are needed?
   - Budget: Break down costs by category with contingencies
   - Timeline: Create detailed schedule with milestones

**4. Implementation Planning Phase**
   - Prepare project schedule with specific milestones
   - Order materials and arrange for deliveries
   - Schedule any required services or contractors
   - Create safety protocols and contingency plans
   - Establish communication channels and reporting

**5. Execution and Monitoring Phase**
   - Execute project following plan
   - Monitor progress and quality
   - Track time and costs against budget
   - Communicate updates regularly
   - Document lessons learned

## Decisions and Assumptions

**Decision 1: Prioritize Water Quality**
Water purifier replacement is prioritized over toilet replacement due to immediate health concerns (reports of poor water quality) and critical need for clean drinking water. This decision reflects health and safety priorities.

**Decision 2: Professional Installation**
Both toilet commode replacement and Aquaguard installation require professional installation. Attempting complex plumbing and electrical work without expertise creates safety risks and potential for expensive damage. This decision prioritizes quality and safety.

**Decision 3: Phased Approach**
Projects will be addressed in phases: critical water quality issue first, followed by toilet replacement when budget allows. This approach minimizes immediate health risks while working within financial constraints.

**Decision 4: Local Vendor Research**
Quotes and research will be conducted with local suppliers to reduce delivery time and build local relationships. This approach prioritizes speed and convenience.

**Decision 5: Contingency Budget**
A 15-20% contingency budget is included for all projects to account for unexpected costs, price fluctuations, and additional materials needed. This approach reduces risk of project delays due to budget constraints.

**Assumptions**:
- Plumbing and electrical infrastructure is compatible with new installations
- Bathroom dimensions will accommodate desired toilet and commode models
- Water purifier installation location has adequate water supply and drainage
- Available budget (1 lakh for toilet, variable for Aquaguard) is realistic
- Installation timelines can be accommodated within 1-2 week window
- Local suppliers can provide quoted services within promised timelines
- Technical complexity is moderate and manageable with professional help
