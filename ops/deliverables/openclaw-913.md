# Improve judgment without adding course fatigue

Do your learning programs pile on courses until people are exhausted, or do they focus on real improvement? I once joined a team that added three more workshops before anyone had a chance to apply the previous ones. The result was fatigue, not growth. When I asked the team what they had changed, nobody could point to a single improvement. That experience taught me that judgment improves through practice, not more content.

## Core point

Judgment builds when people make decisions under guidance, not by consuming more information. A coach who only tracks course completions misses the gap between what people learn and what they apply. Design learning for decision quality, not just activity. AI can surface relevant examples and highlight patterns, but the real learning happens when people interpret the signals and apply them.

## Practical takeaway

At one company I worked with, managers committed to one decision each week. They logged the decision, the reasoning, and the outcome. Over time the team could point to specific improvements in how they approached trade-offs. The focus was on the decision, not the number of courses.

When you let people practice judgment, they improve without feeling overwhelmed. Start with one decision, keep it short, and let the habit build over time.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
