# Coach managers to run better learning conversations in weekly one on ones

I care about coach managers to run better learning conversations in weekly one on ones only when it changes the judgment teams use in daily work, because learning that never touches decisions does not survive pressure. If a manager cannot point to a clearer call during real work, the effort is still theory.

A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.

You can run a short pilot around a focused behavior change, then document what shifted in the team conversation and what did not. That record is more useful than adding another generic course asset.

This also improves quality control in automation: shorter posts stay readable, but the argument still deepens when each paragraph adds a different layer of evidence or judgment. The result feels like a practitioner note, not a template.

If you reviewed your current learning rhythm tomorrow, which decision point would you redesign first so better judgment shows up in workplace outcomes?
