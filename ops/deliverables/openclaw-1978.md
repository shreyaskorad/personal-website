  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual impact. This creates a disconnect where employees click through modules without learning. The issue is often not lack of access, but lack of application. Learners finish compliance modules yet fail to apply that knowledge when high-stakes decisions arrive. Decision quality metrics bridge this gap. Instead of tracking seat time, you measure the outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of successful transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the training program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements? Did it improve the quality of selection decisions compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Teams define criteria and provide feedback to employees on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about.",
