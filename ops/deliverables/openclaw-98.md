## Key AI in L&D Insights

**Core Thesis**: AI is fundamentally transforming the online learning market from "selling courses" to "delivering personalized learning experiences" through AI-native platforms.

**Market Transformation**: The $400B professional development market is collapsing under traditional courseware models and being reborn with AI-driven personalization. Companies like Udemy being acquired by Coursera, stock prices plummeting for LMS/LXP providers—all due to AI's ability to create customized learning experiences on demand.

**Learning Shift**: 900M people use ChatGPT weekly for learning, with 40%+ interactions involving skill development. This exceeds any L&D platform in history because AI allows natural "questioning-based" learning where users ask "why," "how," "more details," creating holistic, non-linear learning experiences.

**AI-First Learning**: The new model uses AI to collect, generate, translate, and deliver content dynamically. Platforms like Galileo (Workday-owned) provide Supertutor agents that adapt to user role, prior interactions, and preferences—delivering courses, simulations, role plays, and expert coaching in real-time.

## Business Model

**Subscription-Based Research Platform**: His core revenue comes from paid access to research reports, including the "2026 Imperatives" package sold through Galileo Suite and corporate memberships.

**Vendor Partnerships**: Strategic partnerships with AI-native L&D vendors like:
- **Galileo** (Workday-owned): AI agent for HR and leadership
- **Sana**: Enterprise-class AI-native learning platform  
- **Arist**: AI-powered micro-learning and performance consulting
- **Uplimit**: AI-driven deep skills development
- **Workera**: AI-driven skills assessment
- **Attensi**: AI-driven simulations and games

**Premium Certifications**: Offers Galileo AI-driven certificate programs on Enterprise AI in HR and the Superworker Organization learning program.

**Podcast & Content Monetization**: Free podcasts and content generate leads for premium research access, webinars, and corporate consulting.

## Approach to AI in L&D

**Superagents & Superworkers**: His central framework focuses on moving beyond individual productivity tools to "Superagents" that automate entire business processes. 30-40% of HR jobs can be automated, transforming HR from administrative to strategic "full-stack" roles.

**AI Architecture-First**: Performance depends on corpus quality (data, knowledge base), not just agent number. Leaders must focus on building proper AI architectures and governance.

**Citizen Development**: Systems require constant tuning using prompts rather than code, requiring leaders to become citizen developers.

**Human-Centric AI**: Despite automation, emphasizes taking care of employees as the most valuable resource—rates of commitment and engagement are plummeting and must be addressed.

**Data Quality & Trust**: With AI moving at speed, accuracy, explainability, and trust become paramount. HR now owns AI bias, data quality, and trust issues.

**Trust Problem**: 70% of US workers don't trust CEO statements about AI job reductions. The solution is open discussion about AI's actual impact (scaling technology, not job elimination) and honest approaches to workforce planning.

**Market Position**: Positioned as the authoritative voice on HR transformation, offering both research insights and practical tools through Galileo for immediate implementation.
