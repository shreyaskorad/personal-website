# Design Manager Enablement That Links Coaching Actions to Team Capability Growth

Manager enablement often separates coaching conversations from broader team capability development. Coaches focus on individual performance while team development happens in isolation. This disconnect weakens both outcomes. I've watched managers become excellent coaches yet fail to build collective team strength because they don't connect their coaching to broader skill building.

## Core point
Effective manager enablement ties coaching directly to team capability building. When managers identify skill gaps during coaching conversations they create opportunities for the whole team to learn together. The coaching becomes a lever for collective improvement rather than isolated performance management.

## Practical takeaway
Before a coaching session ask yourself what capability gap this conversation can address for your entire team. After discussing an individual issue suggest a team activity that addresses the underlying skill gap. If a developer struggles with code reviews ask the team to do a retrospective on their review practices together. Your coaching becomes a tool for building team capability.

Your coaching conversations should always surface team-level learnings. The best managers use individual coaching as a catalyst for group growth.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
