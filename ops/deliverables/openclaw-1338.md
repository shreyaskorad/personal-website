## Deliverable Output
**Topic Discovery**

Shortlist of 3 candidates:
1. **"Make learning data actionable for team leaders not just learning ops"** - Focus on actionability gap between dashboards and team leaders
2. **"Create micro-learning moments in daily team standups"** - Focus on integrating learning into existing workflows
3. **"Use failure reflections to surface learning priorities"** - Focus on failure-driven learning vs completion celebrations

**Selected topic:** "Create micro-learning moments in daily team standups" - Fresh angle within LXD/workflow integration, highly practical, addresses common implementation barrier.

**Thesis:** Team standups already exist—layer micro-learning moments into them instead of adding separate sessions. Turn recurring meetings into deliberate learning opportunities.

**Audience intent:** Team leads and managers wanting to surface learning in natural workflows without additional meetings.

**Evidence requirement:** At least one cited example of team standups with embedded learning triggers
