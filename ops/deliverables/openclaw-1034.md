## Deliverable Output
# Use feedback rituals to convert learning into visible team behavior

I once led a team that struggled to apply new skills after training. We redesigned our feedback process to make learning visible to the whole group. Every Friday, team members shared one concrete thing they applied from the week and one thing they wanted to improve. Their conversations shifted from vague goals to specific actions. Team performance improved because everyone could see progress.

## Core point

Feedback rituals make learning visible and actionable. A team redesigned their process to share one concrete application each Friday. They discussed specific actions instead of vague goals. Their conversations became more focused and their performance improved because everyone could see progress. Teams that turn learning into visible behaviors create accountability and momentum.

## Practical takeaway

What one learning moment could you share this week to make it visible to your team? Design a weekly ritual where one person shares a concrete application and asks for feedback. Track the outcomes.

Visible learning builds momentum and accountability. Your team needs to see progress to stay engaged. Create rituals that surface concrete actions instead of abstract concepts.
