# Build Feedback Rituals That Convert Learning Into Visible Team Behavior

Learning stays theoretical until you build rituals that make it stick. Teams absorb new concepts but struggle to apply them because feedback feels ad-hoc and inconsistent. I've seen teams complete training programs with enthusiastic participants yet watch weeks later as nothing changes. The learning dies because there's no ritual that forces people to practice and get feedback.

## Core point
Feedback rituals create a predictable rhythm where learning happens in real time. Instead of waiting for formal reviews teams implement short weekly check-ins where people share what they applied and what worked. These rituals surface problems early and reinforce good habits. The key is consistency and simplicity.

## Practical takeaway
Start with a two-minute daily check-in where team members state one thing they tried from recent learning and what happened. Follow up with a weekly 15-minute review where you discuss patterns and challenges. The rituals should feel frictionless not burdensome. If people resist the ritual they'll stop learning fast.

Your rituals should amplify learning not dilute it. A simple daily check-in beats a perfect quarterly workshop because it happens in real time and builds practice into daily work.

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
