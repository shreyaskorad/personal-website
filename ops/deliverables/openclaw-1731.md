## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (757)

With decision quality in workplace learning workflows (757), I focus less on content volume and more on the recurring decision moments where managers choose between speed and clarity. That is where capability becomes visible to the business.

In a weekly manager review, I often see teams discuss activity counts while skipping the decision that created avoidable rework. That gap is where learning programs lose trust from the business.

You can run a short pilot around a focused behavior change, then document what shifted in the team conversation and what did not. That record is more useful than adding another generic course asset.

This also improves quality control in automation: shorter posts stay readable, but the argument still deepens when each paragraph adds a different layer of evidence or judgment. The result feels like a practitioner note, not a template.

I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.

What recurring team decision is the best place to test this approach first, before you scale it across the rest of the learning program?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
