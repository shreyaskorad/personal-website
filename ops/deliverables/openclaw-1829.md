  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual capability. A learner might finish a compliance module quickly but still struggle to apply knowledge when it matters most. This disconnect weakens the business case for learning investments. Decision quality metrics solve this problem by shifting focus from inputs to outputs. Instead of tracking seat time or course progress, measure outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of knowledge transfer. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help a hiring manager choose between candidates based on specific role requirements? Did it improve the quality of vendor selections compared to previous cycles? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific contexts and workflows. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with those standards. This shift changes how learning and development demonstrates value. Proving that learning improves decision quality connects development directly to organizational performance metrics that stakeholders actually care about. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning is not just a cost center but a driver of better business outcomes.",
