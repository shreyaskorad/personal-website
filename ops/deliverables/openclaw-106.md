## Decisions and Assumptions

**Decision 1: Emergency Fund Priority**
Emergency funds are prioritized as the foundation of financial security because they provide immediate liquidity during income disruptions or unexpected expenses. The 3-6 month coverage is chosen based on industry standards and variable income scenarios.

**Decision 2: Income Protection Focus**
Income stability is emphasized over aggressive wealth building because losing primary income creates immediate security risks that can compound over time. Insurance and career planning are prioritized over investment optimization during uncertain periods.

**Decision 3: Conservative Risk Tolerance**
During uncertain periods, conservative risk tolerance is recommended to protect capital and maintain stability. More aggressive approaches increase vulnerability during market downturns and economic uncertainty.

**Decision 4: Liquidity Over Growth**
Liquidity is prioritized over investment growth during periods of financial security focus. Emergency funds and liquid assets provide security that long-term investments cannot during financial stress.

**Decision 5: Annual Review Cycle**
Annual comprehensive reviews of financial security measures are recommended to maintain adequacy and adjust based on life changes and economic conditions.

**Assumptions**:
- User may have variable or uncertain income sources
- Comprehensive financial information may not be immediately available
- Professional advice should be sought for complex decisions
- Personal circumstances will evolve over time requiring adjustments
- Security measures must be practical and maintainable
