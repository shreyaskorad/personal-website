  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize seat time metrics over actual impact. This creates a disconnect where learners complete modules yet fail to apply knowledge when it matters most. Decision quality metrics address this gap by focusing on outcomes of real-time decisions. Speed, accuracy and confidence serve as reliable indicators of transfer. Consider a data analysis scenario. A finance analyst needs to decide between launching a new report or delaying it based on incomplete data. Did learning program help them prioritize data integrity over reporting speed? Did it reduce frequency of errors in monthly variance analysis? Measuring decision quality requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific analytical contexts. Learners receive guidance on how their choices align with these standards during training simulations. This shift changes how learning demonstrates value. Connecting learning decisions to data accuracy outcomes validates investment in analytical tools. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that learning drives better business precision.",
