## Summary
Rewrite required before publish. Violations: repeats the same core point

## Deliverable Output
Most learning and development reviews focus on completion rates and participation metrics. This misses the point entirely. True value comes from behavior shifts that stick. I watched a learning team struggle until they redesigned their quarterly reviews around specific behavior changes instead of course completion data. Their managers started having conversations about what people actually changed at work, not just how many modules they finished.

## Core point

Focus L&D reviews on behavior shifts that transfer to the job. A learning team shifted their quarterly reviews from completion rates to specific behavior changes. Their managers discussed what actually changed at work, not just how many modules learners finished. This simple pivot made reviews more actionable and aligned with business goals.

## Practical takeaway

What single behavior change would make the biggest difference for your team? Build that into your next review cycle instead of focusing on activity metrics. Track whether that behavior actually shifts and iterate based on what works.

Reviews become powerful when they focus on what people actually do differently, not just how many courses they complete. Teams that align learning conversations with real behavior changes create more value than those that measure activity alone.
