# Coach managers to run better learning conversations in weekly o

The most useful test for coach managers to run better learning conversations in weekly o is simple: can people make sharper decisions with less confusion during real project work. Completion metrics can look strong while workplace behavior stays unchanged.

A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.

I start with one decision checkpoint, one owner, and one evidence signal that can be reviewed in the next team meeting. This keeps the experiment small enough to sustain and concrete enough to learn from.

I have found that this approach keeps writing and execution coherent, because each iteration adds a fresh angle while staying anchored to the same operating problem. That balance helps the voice stay independent instead of echoing one source.

When this becomes part of normal team practice, people stop treating learning as separate from delivery and start using it to improve judgment where it matters most. That shift is usually the difference between activity and capability.

Where in your next manager check-in could you replace activity updates with a sharper conversation about decision quality?
