  "article_content":"Workplace safety training often uses generic modules that fail to address real-time risk. AI-driven scenario learning solves this by generating dynamic simulations tailored to specific roles. Instead of static compliance lists, learners face situations that mirror their actual job hazards. This approach improves decision quality in the moment of need. Consider a project safety scenario. A standard module might list generic hazards. An AI simulation can present a specific, nuanced technical failure based on a team's historical incident data. This context shift changes how safety demonstrates value. Linking training to safety outcomes proves impact. By measuring decision quality, teams can show that safety is a driver of operational excellence.",
