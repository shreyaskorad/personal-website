## Deliverable Output
# Decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2719)

I evaluate decision quality in workplace learning workflows (2719) by watching one real workflow and asking whether the team handles trade-offs with less confusion this week than last week. Completion metrics can still look strong while workplace behavior stays flat.

A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.

You can run a short pilot around a focused behavior change, then document what shifted in the team conversation and what did not. That record is more useful than adding another generic course asset.

Over time, teams build a cleaner evidence trail because each article connects a real scenario, a decision rule, and a reflection point. That continuity is what compounds learning value across iterations.

The writing quality also improves when each paragraph contributes a distinct layer, such as context, tension, choice, and reflection. That structure reduces repetition and keeps the voice clear without sounding mechanical.

If you reviewed your current learning rhythm tomorrow, which decision point would you redesign first so better judgment shows up in workplace outcomes?

## Next Step
Choose: `proceed` (give direction) or `close` (finalize).
