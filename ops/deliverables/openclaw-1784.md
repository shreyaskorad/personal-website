  "article_content":"Workplace learning programs often prioritize completion rates over actual capability building. This creates a false sense of value. Learners might finish modules quickly but still struggle to apply knowledge when it matters most. Decision quality metrics solve this disconnect. Instead of tracking seat time, measure the outcomes of decisions learners make using new knowledge. Consider a hiring scenario. Did the learning program help the hiring manager choose between candidates based on role fit rather than gut feeling? Did it improve the quality of vendor selections? These specific workplace outcomes matter more than total hours spent. By measuring decision quality, L&D teams align learning investments directly with business performance. This approach requires defining what a good decision looks like for specific roles and contexts. It involves gathering feedback from stakeholders after decisions are made, not just when training concludes. It shifts the focus from learning consumption to learning application. Teams can implement this by identifying three to five critical decision points in a workflow. They track whether learners make decisions that meet predefined criteria. This simple framework turns vague learning goals into measurable business impact.",
