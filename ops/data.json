The supervisor explicitly stated:\n\n- Article 'Design without losing human judgment' already published and verified live at https://shreyaskorad.in/posts/design-without-losing-human-judgment.html. 200 status code co... (action: No new publishing needed for this topic. Requesting user clarification on desired next action.; handoff_to: supervisor)\n\nI have already verified in my previous work that this article is live at the correct URL. The supervisor has clearly indicated that no new publishing is needed for this topic and that they want user clarification on what to do next.\n\nI should:\n1. Report the status as completed (since the article is already published)\n2. Include the publish QA evidence showing the article is live\n3. Provide measurement handoff\n4. Ask the user what they would like to do next\n\nThis is not a case where I need to create a new article - the task description says \"Write one publish-ready article\" but the memory shows it's already published and the supervisor said no new publishing is needed.\n\nLet me provide the final JSON response with all the required information."
