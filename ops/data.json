You look at completion rates and satisfaction scores but miss the real impact on how people work. I've reviewed countless L&D reports where the metrics look impressive yet I can't find evidence of actual behavior change. The reviews become vanity metrics that signal learning is happening without proving it matters.\n\n## Core point\n\nBehavior shifts drive business results more than completion rates ever will. When your reviews focus on how people apply what they learned you surface real impact instead of fake progress. The trick is designing reviews that look for evidence of change in daily work rather than evidence of attendance.\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nAsk managers to identify specific behaviors that changed after learning interventions. Instead of asking Did your team complete the training ask Did they handle customer complaints differently last month. Your reviews should surface stories about improved decisions rather than stories about finished courses.\n\nYour reviews will feel messier but they'll reveal what actually moves the needle. Behavior shifts take time to appear so give your reviews space to show patterns over multiple quarters. The clarity that emerges from focusing on behavior beats the clean numbers from completion dashboards."
