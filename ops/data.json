Keep it practical: decision quality, evidence linked to business metrics, and real implementation examples. Follow strict style rules: 150-200 words, no bullets, no em dash, no blockquotes. Do not use precise numeric claims unless cited with a verifiable source link. Avoid repeating the same core point across paragraphs; maintain natural narrative flow."
