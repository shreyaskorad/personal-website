When I asked teams to describe a single decision they handled differently after a workshop, the conversation revealed real impact and gave me evidence to share with leadership.\n\n## Core point\n\nShifting the review from a checklist to observable behavior lets L&D tie learning to business outcomes. By using simple data points such as the frequency of a new practice or a change in a decision log, you can surface whether the learning sticks. AI tools can surface these signals from collaboration platforms without adding manual work. What behavior would you measure to know learning mattered?\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nImagine a product team that just finished a design sprint. Instead of asking for a completion badge, ask each member to note one habit they will try next week and record the result in the sprint retro. Track those notes for a month and discuss the pattern in your L&D review.\n\nFocusing on behavior, not just numbers, turns learning into a living part of work and gives you the proof you need to keep investing in it."
