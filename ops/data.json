Track both leading indicators (blind spots surfaced) and lagging indicators (decision quality improvement) in your weekly reviews.\n\n## Practical takeaway\nName one leading metric and one lagging metric for your AI feedback system. Surface blind spots weekly, not monthly, and use the pattern data to spot gaps before they compound into systemic issues.\n\nAI feedback loops that surface blind spots, not just isolated wins starts with alignment: define what counts as a blind spot, surface it weekly, and trace how spotting it improves downstream decisions. Measure one leading KPI and one lagging KPI per sprint to avoid vague progress claims.\n\nNext week, run one focused experiment for AI feedback loops, compare baseline versus delta, and keep only the change that improves both blind spot detection and decision quality."

You might have asked yourself whether following strict guidelines protects your work or limits your judgment. When I guide teams through LXD workshops, I notice designers who replicate patterns without understanding why. This creates surface-level consistency while losing the ability to connect with users.\n\nA product lead recently told me their team standardized every button and header using their design system. But when users couldn't complete critical tasks, the team realized they had removed the very flexibility needed for good judgment. Their solution wasn't to abandon the system but to build guardrails that protect intent without removing decision space.\n\nAsk yourself which patterns in your current work came from thinking versus memorization. Good design systems should clarify what to do and when to break rules, not hide the thinking behind decisions.\n\nThis balance matters because products serve real people with diverse needs, not templates. Your best design work happens at the intersection of clear frameworks and human judgment."
