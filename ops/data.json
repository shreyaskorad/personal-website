You look at completion rates and satisfaction scores but miss the real impact on how people work. I've reviewed countless L&D reports where the metrics look impressive yet I can't find evidence of actual behavior change. The reviews become vanity metrics that signal learning is happening without proving it matters.\n\n## Core point\n\nBehavior shifts drive business results more than completion rates ever will. When your reviews focus on how people apply what they learned you surface real impact instead of fake progress. The trick is designing reviews that look for evidence of change in daily work rather than evidence of attendance.\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nAsk managers to identify specific behaviors that changed after learning interventions. Instead of asking Did your team complete the training ask Did they handle customer complaints differently last month. Your reviews should surface stories about improved decisions rather than stories about finished courses.\n\nYour reviews will feel messier but they'll reveal what actually moves the needle. Behavior shifts take time to appear so give your reviews space to show patterns over multiple quarters. The clarity that emerges from focusing on behavior beats the clean numbers from completion dashboards."

Managers focus on what's not working without pausing to explore what's working. I've sat in countless meetings where the manager asks a laundry list of questions and the employee just answers yes or no without any reflection.\n\n## Core point\n\nLearning conversations require structure and curiosity. Managers should design their one-on-ones around three questions that surface insight and growth. The conversation becomes a genuine exploration instead of a performance review.\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nStructure each one-on-one around three questions. Start with what went well last week. Then ask what challenges you faced and how you overcame them. End with what you're planning to tackle next week and what you need help with. This simple framework forces managers to be curious about both wins and struggles.\n\nYour one-on-ones will feel different when you prioritize learning over status updates. The conversations become richer because you're asking about growth not just output."
