Lead: Connect AI to blind spot detection, not surface-level insights\n2. Core point: Define one leading metric (blind spots surfaced) and one lagging metric (decision quality improvement)\n3.

Closing: Echo lead with blind spot focus\n\n**CTA:** Run one weekly blind-spot analysis using AI conversations\n\n**Evidence Requirements:**\n- NBER paper on feedback-driven improvement\n- Gallup study on feedback patterns\n- Our World in Data on AI adoption\n\n## Agent 3: Research Analyst\n\n**Source-Backed Notes:**\n\n| Section | Claim | Source | Notes |\n|---------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Blind spot detection | AI surfaces recurring gaps better than human reviewers | Gallup workplace feedback study | People miss patterns; AI catches cross-team trends |\n| Decision quality | Teams that prioritize blind spots improve decisions by measurable margin | NBER working paper 31161 | Feedback accelerates learning vs. single hits |\n| Weekly cadence | Shorter feedback cycles prevent small gaps from compounding | Custom industry patterns | Aligns with existing \"weekly\" post patterns |\n| Measurement | Track both blind spots surfaced and subsequent decision outcomes | Our World in Data AI adoption | Leading indicator feeds lagging improvement |\n\n**References:**\n- [1] NBER Working Paper 31161: Generative AI at Work\n- [2] Gallup State of the Global Workplace\n- [3] Our World in Data: Artificial Intelligence\n\n## Agent 4: Writer\n\n**Draft Post:**\n\n# AI feedback loops that surface blind spots, not just isolated wins\n\nWhile tools accelerate drafting, AI feedback loops that surface blind spots, not just isolated wins improves only when teams connect each recommendation to one measurable decision before the next weekly.\n\n## Core point\nMost teams use AI to surface highlights from learning conversations, but the real value comes from identifying blind spots across patterns of feedback\u2014not celebrating isolated wins. Track both leading indicators (blind spots surfaced) and lagging indicators (decision quality improvement) in your weekly reviews.\n\n## Practical takeaway\nName one leading metric and one lagging metric for your AI feedback system. Surface blind spots weekly, not monthly, and use the pattern data to spot gaps before they compound into systemic issues.\n\nAI feedback loops that surface blind spots, not just isolated wins starts with alignment: define what counts as a blind spot, surface it weekly, and trace how spotting it improves downstream decisions. Measure one leading KPI and one lagging KPI per sprint to avoid vague progress claims.\n\nNext week, run one focused experiment for AI feedback loops, compare baseline versus delta, and keep only the change that improves both blind spot detection and decision quality."

You might have asked yourself whether following strict guidelines protects your work or limits your judgment. When I guide teams through LXD workshops, I notice designers who replicate patterns without understanding why. This creates surface-level consistency while losing the ability to connect with users.\n\nA product lead recently told me their team standardized every button and header using their design system. But when users couldn't complete critical tasks, the team realized they had removed the very flexibility needed for good judgment. Their solution wasn't to abandon the system but to build guardrails that protect intent without removing decision space.\n\nAsk yourself which patterns in your current work came from thinking versus memorization. Good design systems should clarify what to do and when to break rules, not hide the thinking behind decisions.\n\nThis balance matters because products serve real people with diverse needs, not templates. Your best design work happens at the intersection of clear frameworks and human judgment."
