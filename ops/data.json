In my team we saw high completion numbers while the same old habits persisted. What if we measured what truly moved instead of what was simply logged?\n\n## Core point\n\nWe replaced the completion dashboard with a simple question: after a learning event, what concrete behavior changed? The team logged these observations in a shared note, linked each shift to a business outcome, and retired the old metric\u2011only view. Managers reported clearer alignment between learning and daily work, and employees felt their effort mattered.\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nAdd a one\u2011sentence field to your review form that captures the most visible behavior change. Ask the learner to note one example and the manager to confirm it in the next one\u2011on\u2011one. Use those notes to update performance metrics instead of a static completion count.\n\nFocus on behavior shifts, not dashboards, and watch learning become a visible part of everyday work."

In my team we saw high completion numbers while the same old habits persisted. What if we measured what truly moved instead of what was simply logged?\n\n## Core point\n\nWe replaced the completion dashboard with a simple question: after a learning event, what concrete behavior changed? The team logged these observations in a shared note, linked each shift to a business outcome, and retired the old metric\u2011only view. Managers reported clearer alignment between learning and daily work, and employees felt their effort mattered.\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nAdd a one\u2011sentence field to your review form that captures the most visible behavior change. Ask the learner to note one example and the manager to confirm it in the next one\u2011on\u2011one. Use those notes to update performance metrics instead of a static completion count.\n\nFocus on behavior shifts, not dashboards, and watch learning become a visible part of everyday work."
