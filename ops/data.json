Let me start with topic discovery.\n\n**Topic Discovery Phase**\n\nBased on the title, here are 3 candidate topics:\n\n1. **Judgment-Enhanced Learning Without Course Fatigue**: How to improve decision quality through lightweight learning interventions that don't overwhelm learners with additional courses\n\n2. **Micro-Learning for Judgment Improvement**: Delivering judgment-supporting learning at the point of decision rather than in standalone courses\n\n3. **Practice-Based Judgment Training**: Using low-stakes practice environments to build decision judgment without consuming course time\n\n**Selected Topic:** Judgment-Enhanced Learning Without Course Fatigue\n\n**Thesis:** Teams can improve decision judgment without additional course fatigue by delivering targeted learning exactly when it's needed at the point of decision.\n\n**Audience Intent:** LxD leaders and team managers seeking ways to enhance decision quality without overwhelming learners with more courses\n\n**Topic validated as unique and actionable.**"
