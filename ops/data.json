This misses the point entirely. True value comes from behavior shifts that stick. One company shifted their quarterly review process to focus entirely on behavior changes. Leaders asked what actions changed after learning interventions and how those changes affected team performance. The team saw clear connections between learning investments and business outcomes. They also identified which interventions actually worked and which were just busy work.\n\n## Core point\n\nCreate L&D reviews that focus on behavior shifts not completion dashboards by measuring actual changes in how people work and what they do differently.
