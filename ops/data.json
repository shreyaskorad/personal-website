I once joined a team of six engineers who wanted to improve their shipping velocity but had no systematic way to share lessons between sprints. They decided to add a fifteen-minute learning session after each sprint review.\n\n## Core point\n\nWe built a simple workflow that starts with identifying one learning from the completed sprint. The team discusses what worked, what didn't, and what they will try next. This happens every Friday before planning the next sprint. The learning session is short and tied directly to the work they just delivered. Over time the team accumulated a repository of practical lessons that improved their decision quality and reduced repeated mistakes.\n\n## Practical takeaway\n\nAfter each sprint, ask your team to share one learning and one action they will take in the next sprint. Keep the session to fifteen minutes and focus on concrete takeaways. The learning session becomes part of your weekly rhythm, not an extra meeting.\n\nWhat one weekly rhythm could most strengthen your team's learning and shipping? By making learning a regular part of your weekly workflow you create a sustainable system that improves both execution and judgment."
