            <p class="post-lead">Build discipline is not about moving slower. It is about making quality visible early so teams can ship with confidence. In practical terms, discipline means clear definitions, tight feedback loops, and consistent decision records.</p>

            <h2>Define quality before development starts</h2>
            <p>Teams lose speed when quality criteria are vague. I prefer writing a short quality contract before work begins, including expected user behavior, known constraints, and what success should look like after release.</p>
            <p>This reduces thrash in the middle of execution. Designers, engineers, and managers can make faster tradeoffs because they are aligned on what matters most and what can wait.</p>
            <h2>Review decisions, not just output</h2>
            <p>A healthy weekly review asks why key decisions were made and what evidence supported them. That creates shared judgment and helps newer team members learn how strong decisions are formed.</p>
            <p>Over time, this habit builds reliability. Delivery becomes less dependent on heroic effort and more dependent on repeatable operating rhythms that survive deadlines and context switching.</p>
            <p>Track one decision-quality signal and one execution signal each week.</p>
            <p>Review these signals with owners before adding new work in progress.</p>
            <p>Day-to-day discipline is the foundation for sustainable speed. Which decision pattern in your current workflow keeps creating avoidable rework?</p>
