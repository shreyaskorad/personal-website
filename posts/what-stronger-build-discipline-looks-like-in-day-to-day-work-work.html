            <h2>Core point</h2>
            <p>The strongest shift happens when you connect learning moments to decisions managers and teams already face each week. In one workplace scenario, a team lead reviews a project handoff with a learner and uses a short debrief to surface trade-offs, not just whether a module was completed. That conversation becomes a coaching artifact the manager can revisit in the next project cycle to calibrate expectations and accountability.</p>
            <p>A fast quality check is to compare recent coaching notes and ask whether decisions improved in real project moments.</p>
            <h2>Practical takeaway</h2>
            <p>Choose one decision your learners repeatedly struggle with, define what better judgment looks like, and gather lightweight evidence from team conversations and outcomes. Track one behavioral signal in weekly check-ins, and compare examples before and after the coaching shift so improvement is visible. What would change in your team if learning reviews focused on better decisions instead of completion updates?</p>
            <p>This practice stays credible when manager coaching improves decision quality, strengthens team dialogue, and shows visible capability growth at work.</p>
            <p>Track one leading metric and one lagging metric every week.</p>
            <p>Use external links only when they sharpen a specific claim.</p>
            <p>This practice stays credible when manager coaching improves decision quality, strengthens team dialogue, and shows visible capability growth at work.</p>
