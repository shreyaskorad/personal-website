            <p class="post-lead">Strategy rarely fails because the plan is weak. It usually fails when teams cannot translate intent into daily decisions. I have seen good strategies stall because owners could not connect priorities to concrete weekly behavior.</p>

            <p>The first break shows up in handoffs. Leaders describe outcomes, but teams receive activity lists. That gap creates motion without progress because success is measured by completion, not by improved decisions.</p>
            <p>The second break appears in review rituals. If reviews focus on status updates, teams hide uncertainty. If reviews focus on assumptions, evidence, and tradeoffs, execution quality rises quickly.</p>
            <p>Define one operating question for each priority, then review it weekly: what did we believe, what happened, and what changed? This keeps strategy alive instead of freezing it into quarterly slides.</p>
            <p>Execution improves when teams can adjust without waiting for a major planning cycle. Small corrections made every week prevent expensive resets later.</p>
            <p>Strategy and execution stay coherent when learning is built into delivery, not added after failure. Which one of your current priorities needs a sharper weekly learning loop?</p>
