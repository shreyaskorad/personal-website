            <p>Teams often complete training but nothing changes. Learning stays at the individual level. You can fix this by building feedback rituals that convert insights into visible team behavior.</p>
            <p>Feedback breaks the invisible-to-visible pipeline. When you structure feedback around checkpoints, reflection, and alignment, learning automatically becomes team behavior. The ritual replaces individual notes with shared commitments.</p>
            <p>Checkpoints force people to articulate what they learned. Reflection turns feedback into action plans. Alignment ensures team members commit to applying learnings together. These three patterns create a feedback loop that sustains behavioral change.</p>
            <p>Create one ritual before your next learning session. Start with a weekly checkpoint: What did you learn last week that changed how you work? Follow with reflection: What feedback did you receive, and what will you try differently? End with alignment: How can we apply what we learned to our next project?</p>
            <p>Track behavior change metrics weekly. Measure which learnings actually got applied and which team members followed through. This data tells you which rituals work and which need refinement.</p>
            <p>Learning becomes real only when teams act on it. Build feedback rituals that convert individual insights into coordinated team actions.</p>
