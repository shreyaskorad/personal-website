            <p>Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta aren't just using AI. They're building the foundations. They pour billions into data centers, GPU clusters, and energy infrastructure. This spending creates jobs too. Data center construction, energy grid upgrades, network infrastructure, and ongoing operations all require human labor. Every new data center needs engineers, technicians, security staff, and support personnel. The physical infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance, upgrades, and expansion as demand grows. This creates employment in construction, engineering, facilities management, and specialized technical roles.</p>

            <h2>The Cloud Providers</h2>
            <p>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud sell AI infrastructure to everyone else. Companies can rent compute power instead of building their own. This model scales AI adoption without requiring each company to fund massive infrastructure projects. The cloud providers make money from demand, so they invest in capacity as needed. Startups can access AI capabilities without upfront capital investments, which accelerates innovation. Enterprise companies can scale up or down based on usage, avoiding overprovisioning. The distributed nature of cloud infrastructure spreads investment across many customers while creating centralized jobs in data center operations and support.</p>

            <h2>Who Loses</h2>
            <p>The displacement problem isn't solved by infrastructure spending. The same companies that build AI also automate the work that would have been done by humans. The risk is misalignment: infrastructure investments create jobs, but not necessarily in the same industries or skill levels that people currently have. A truck driver might lose their job to autonomous vehicles while the infrastructure sector creates demand for robotics engineers and data center technicians. Workers need pathways to transition into these new roles through retraining and education. The challenge is that traditional education systems often move too slowly to match the pace of technological change.</p>
