        <p>L&D reviews often default to tracking completion rates and quiz scores. This creates a surface-level metric that tells you nothing about whether learning actually changed behavior. You can have perfect completion dashboards while teams repeat the same mistakes week after week.</p>
        <p>Review your current L&D evaluation process. Ask yourself what one team member has genuinely changed in how they work as a result of your last training program. If you cannot answer this clearly, your reviews are measuring the wrong thing.</p>
        <p>A practical approach is to add behavior-specific questions to your review framework. Instead of asking "Did they finish the module?", ask "What different decision would they make this week because of this learning?" This shifts the focus from passive consumption to active application. One client replaced all completion checkboxes with behavior-specific feedback questions and saw increased application frequency within the first month.</p>
        <p>Learning happens through repeated practice and feedback, not single exposures to content. Structured reviews that specifically target behavior shifts create the necessary repetition loop. When leaders consistently ask about behavioral changes, it reinforces new habits and highlights areas needing additional support. Your next review cycle should start with behavioral questions before diving into completion metrics.</p>
        <p>L&D reviews that focus on behavior shifts reveal what actually works in your training programs. The data will be messier than completion dashboards, but it will show real improvement over time.</p>
