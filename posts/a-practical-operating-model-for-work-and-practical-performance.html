            <p class="post-lead">Consistent performance comes from operating discipline, not occasional bursts of effort. The model I trust most combines clear priorities, short decision cycles, and transparent review rituals that keep teams aligned during change.</p>

            <h2>Anchor the model in a few non-negotiables</h2>
            <p>Every team needs a small set of operating rules: define outcomes before tasks, assign clear owners, and track one leading signal plus one lagging signal for each priority. This keeps work grounded in results.</p>
            <p>When these rules are stable, teams make faster tradeoffs because they do not renegotiate basics each week. Energy shifts from coordination friction to actual delivery.</p>
            <h2>Use weekly reviews to maintain performance</h2>
            <p>A strong weekly review examines decisions, risks, and learning, not just completion status. This creates a feedback loop where teams can correct direction while work is still recoverable.</p>
            <p>The model stays practical when it is lightweight enough to run under pressure. If the rhythm breaks during busy weeks, the design is too heavy and should be simplified.</p>
            <p>Track one decision-quality signal and one execution signal each week.</p>
            <p>Review these signals with owners before adding new work in progress.</p>
            <p>Performance becomes consistent when the operating model is clear, repeatable, and easy to sustain. Which rule in your current operating rhythm would most improve reliability if enforced weekly?</p>
