            <p class="post-lead">Most cross-functional learning happens accidentally through project retrospectives, but teams that make it intentional see dramatically better outcomes.</p>

        <article class="post-content">
            <h2>Why cross-functional learning often fails</h2>
            <p>Teams assume learning will happen automatically through collaboration, but the opposite is true. Cross-functional work creates boundaries that actually hide knowledge instead of making it accessible. When teams only reflect at the end of projects, they miss opportunities to course-correct in real time and preserve learning for future teams.</p>

            <h2>One repeatable pattern that works</h2>
            <p>Build learning checkpoints directly into cross-functional workflows. Instead of waiting for retrospectives, capture one insight at every major milestone or handoff. Design teams, for example, could capture one learning after each sprint review with engineering partners. Product managers could document one lesson learned after each customer feedback session with sales teams. These small moments compound over time into a reusable knowledge base that helps future teams avoid the same mistakes and build on past successes.</p>

            <p>Make cross-functional learning deliberate, not accidental, and the boundary between departments becomes a source of strength rather than a silo that hides knowledge.</p>
