            <p class="post-lead">AI tools keep appearing faster than anyone can integrate them into learning design work. I recently watched an instructional designer spend two days evaluating whether to adopt a new AI writing assistant that promised to cut content creation time in half. The tool looked impressive but left no room for human judgment or the subtle cultural context that makes learning stick.</p>

            <p>One LxD team adopted an AI image generator for their visual metaphors instead of using stock photos that felt generic. The tool saved them hours but they still reviewed every output for cultural appropriateness and learning relevance.</p>
            <p>A compliance trainer chose an AI summarizer that worked directly inside their document editor. Within weeks they reduced their compliance content preparation time by 35 percent without learning a new system.</p>
            <p>Teams that experiment with specific use cases see faster returns than those that chase every new feature.</p>
            <p>What AI tool would most help your team create learning that actually sticks?</p>
            <p>Test one new AI tool each quarter instead of adopting everything at once</p>
