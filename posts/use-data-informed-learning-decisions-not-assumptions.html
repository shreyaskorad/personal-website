            <p class="post-lead">Learning teams often make decisions based on gut feeling instead of evidence. I recently watched a LxD team redesign their onboarding program after they noticed users completing modules at different rates. The new version improved completion by 15 percent without any additional features or costs.</p>

            <p>Learning decisions improve when teams stop relying on assumptions and start reading patterns in real behavior. Completion data alone rarely tells the full story. What matters is whether people can apply what they learned when it counts.</p>
            <p>A useful data habit is to combine signals: learner behavior, manager observations, and business performance markers connected to the capability being developed. Looking at these together reveals where programs are helping and where they are creating activity without impact.</p>
            <p>Data-informed practice does not require perfect dashboards. It requires consistent questions, honest interpretation, and the discipline to adjust programs based on evidence rather than preference. Small refinements made regularly are often more effective than occasional large redesigns.</p>
            <p>Which decision in your learning strategy are you currently making on instinct alone? Start by instrumenting that one decision and use what you learn to improve the next cycle.</p>
