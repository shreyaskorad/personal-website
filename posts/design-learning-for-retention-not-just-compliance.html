            <p>One software company redesigned their onboarding to include weekly skill-building challenges instead of one-time compliance checks. Six months later their employee retention improved by 23 percent and most employees engaged with content multiple times per week.</p>
            <p>A healthcare system redesigned their leadership training around the specific conflicts their managers reported each week. The new approach increased course completion by 40 percent and managers actually applied what they learned.</p>
            <p>Teams that design for ongoing engagement see better long-term results than those that focus only on initial completion.</p>
