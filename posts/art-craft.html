            <p>The craft of building with code keeps getting easier. AI assistants, better frameworks, and automated testing reduce the friction of writing working code. The syntax, the boilerplate, and the debugging. These parts are becoming commodities.</p>
            <p>The art isn't disappearing. It's becoming more important.</p>
            <p>Art is about judgment: deciding what to build, why it matters, and how it fits into a larger system. It's thinking through trade-offs, anticipating edge cases, and building for long-term maintainability instead of quick wins.</p>
            <p>As implementation costs drop, the competition shifts from who can build faster to who can think more clearly about what we're building. The bar for a decent implementation goes down, but the bar for good system design goes up.</p>
            <p>The people who excel aren't just good with tools. They're good with problems.</p>
