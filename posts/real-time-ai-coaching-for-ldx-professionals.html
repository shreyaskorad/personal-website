            <p>Learning designers face countless decisions about content structure, assessment design, facilitation approaches, and technology choices. Most work in isolation without real-time feedback. The result is slow iteration cycles and repeated mistakes.

            <h2>AI coaching can provide instant feedback on design work</h2>

            <p>AI tools can give instant feedback on design drafts, suggest improvements based on best practices, and answer questions about learning theory. These tools work alongside LxD professionals, not replace them. They help designers make better decisions faster without waiting for peer review or manager approval.

            <h2>Several AI tools now understand instructional design principles</h2>

            <p>Tools like assessment designers, content reviewers, and facilitation coaches help with specific design tasks. Learning designers can experiment with these tools and integrate them into their workflow.

            <h2>Try it with a real design task this week</h2>

            <p>Pick one area where you regularly seek feedback and find an AI tool that addresses that need. Try it with a real design task this week and see if it saves you time or improves your work. Share what works with other LxD professionals in your organization.</p>
