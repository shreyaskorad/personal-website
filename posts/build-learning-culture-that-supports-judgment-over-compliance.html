            <p class="post-lead">Most organizations prioritize compliance over judgment, which stifles learning and innovation. One company shifted their culture to reward learning from failures instead of punishing mistakes. They redesigned their performance system to evaluate what people learned, not just what they did. The culture change reduced fear of experimentation and increased innovation velocity. Teams felt safe to make decisions, fail, and learn without blame. Leaders also modeled learning behavior by sharing their own mistakes and what they learned from them.</p>
