# Design learning programs that tie to business metrics

When I look at most learning programs, I see a focus on completion rates and quiz scores that don't map to business outcomes. I believe we can do better by connecting learning directly to the metrics that matter to the business. The goal isn't to show that learners finished courses but to demonstrate that they're applying what they learned to improve results.

## Core point

You don't need sophisticated analytics to start. Identify the key performance indicators that matter for each role, then design learning experiences that target those outcomes directly. Track how learners behave after training and correlate those behaviors with the business metrics you care about. This gives you a clear line of sight from learning to impact.

## Practical takeaway

In a sales enablement program, we connected new product training to upsell conversion rates. We saw that reps who completed the training and used the new materials had higher upsell rates than those who didn't. This simple link made it easy to show business value and justify future investment.

How could you connect your next learning program to a business metric that leadership cares about?

When learning programs are designed to drive business outcomes, they become strategic assets rather than nice-to-have activities. Tying learning to metrics gives you the evidence you need to build support.
