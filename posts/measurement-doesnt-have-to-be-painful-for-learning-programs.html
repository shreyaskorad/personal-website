            <p>Core issue in execution The issue is rarely effort. Set a baseline by day 1, check throughput by day 7, and keep only changes that reduce rework by at least 10%. First define the decision, then test one change, and finally document the observed effect with a linked source. <sup><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gallup: State of the Global Workplace">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>It is usually weak translation from insight to daily decisions. Track retention and cycle time each week, then compare the current delta against the prior two-week average. Instead of broad theory, run a small experiment and review the result in the next weekly brief. <sup><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Our World in Data: Artificial Intelligence">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>In measurement doesn&#x27;t have to be painful for learning. Measure one leading KPI and one lagging KPI per sprint so signals stay comparable across teams. While drafting, keep claims short and verify every external assertion against a study URL before publication. <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at Labor Market Impact Potential (arXiv:2303.10130)">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Without clear scope, articles drift into broad advice that readers cannot test in their current context. Record before and after values for adoption, error rate, and response time to keep improvement claims testable. First define the decision, then test one change, and finally document the observed effect with a linked source with baseline and delta. <sup><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Generative AI at Work (NBER Working Paper 31161)">[4]</a></sup></p>
