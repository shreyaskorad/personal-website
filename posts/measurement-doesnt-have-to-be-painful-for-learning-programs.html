            <p class="post-lead">Learning leaders everywhere struggle with measurement frameworks that feel like reporting work masquerading as evaluation. You know the pattern. Create elaborate dashboards with learning completion rates and skill assessments, then stare at beautiful charts that don't tell you whether learning actually helped the business.</p>

            <h2>What good measurement actually looks like</h2>
            <p>Start with signals, not metrics. A signal is something a manager notices day-to-day, like "Project X finally finished on time this quarter" or "The team stopped making the same mistake with customer pricing." Signals are grounded in reality and don't require counting clicks and logins.</p>

            <h2>One intervention, one business metric</h2>
            <p>The simplest pattern works: pick one business metric that should improve when learning succeeds, then watch that metric over time. Training project managers on negotiation shouldn't focus on course completion. It should focus on whether projects now complete on time or whether negotiations close faster. The metric lives in the business, not the learning system.</p>

            <h2>Measurement as conversation starter</h2>
            <p>The most powerful measurement is a simple question you ask managers after an intervention: "What signals tell you learning helped?" Their answer reveals whether learning connected to real behavior change without requiring complex analysis. You're not measuring with numbers, you're gathering evidence through conversation.</p>

            <p>Good measurement lives in the business, not the learning system. Start with signals, link to one business metric, ask questions instead of building dashboards, and focus on evidence over efficiency.</p>
