            <p class="post-lead">Teams often use simulated scenarios for learning instead of making real decisions. One company redesigned their learning approach to include real decision-making opportunities during actual projects. They gave teams access to live data and real constraints, then asked them to make decisions and live with the consequences. The team tracked decision quality and business outcomes over six months. Decision confidence improved and error rates decreased compared to teams using only simulated scenarios. Leaders also used these real decisions to surface blind spots and strengthen collective judgment capabilities.</p>
