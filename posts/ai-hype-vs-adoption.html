            <p>Everything is overhyped to get attention. Rage bait. Clickbait. Any sort of hook to grab our focus. But how much of our work is actually influenced by AI? How many products launch with speed that far outpaces adoption?</p>
            <p>The speed of adoption itself is slow compared to launch speed. So much hype and exaggeration has happened. That slows us down from adopting good AI products. We need to slow down instead of rushing. Look through the hype and see what actually works. Then take it forward in a systematic logical way.</p>
            <p>Don't let the noise drown out the signal. Focus on products that fit into your workflow. Focus on tools that solve real problems. Ignore the endless stream of new launches. Build your own patterns of adoption based on what you actually need.</p>
