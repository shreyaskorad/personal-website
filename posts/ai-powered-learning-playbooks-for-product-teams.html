            <p>Core point Product teams waste time making decisions they have already faced before simply because they cannot easily access patterns from previous projects that might otherwise help them avoid mistakes. <sup><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Generative AI at Work (NBER Working Paper 31161)">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>AI tools can surface these patterns and package them into reusable playbooks that guide teams through common challenges without reinventing solutions each time they encounter similar situations. <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at Labor Market Impact Potential (arXiv:2303.10130)">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>This approach transforms isolated project learnings into collective knowledge that scales across the organization and improves consistency across teams while capturing wisdom that might otherwise be lost. <sup><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Our World in Data: Artificial Intelligence">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Teams build playbooks by capturing decision outcomes and asking AI to identify patterns and suggest approaches for similar situations based on what has worked before. <sup><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gallup: State of the Global Workplace">[4]</a></sup></p>
            <p>The playbooks become living documents that evolve as teams discover new patterns and refine existing guidance based on real outcomes and changing conditions in the market. <sup><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Generative AI at Work (NBER Working Paper 31161)">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Organizations that invest in AI-powered playbooks reduce cycle time for product development and improve decision quality across all teams through shared learning and reduced repetitive work while building a stronger knowledge foundation that sustains competitive advantage. <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at Labor Market Impact Potential (arXiv:2303.10130)">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Practical takeaway Create a simple playbook for the most common product decision by capturing three to five previous examples and asking AI to identify patterns. <sup><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Our World in Data: Artificial Intelligence">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Share these playbooks in a central knowledge repository <sup><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gallup: State of the Global Workplace">[4]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Track one leading metric and one lagging metric.</p>
            <p>Carry one measured lesson into the next weekly brief.</p>
            <p>Share these playbooks in a central knowledge repository where teams can reference them during planning sessions and design reviews to ensure alignment and consistency. <sup><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Generative AI at Work (NBER Working Paper 31161)">[1]</a></sup></p>
