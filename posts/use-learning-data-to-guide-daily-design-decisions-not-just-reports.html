            <h2>Data becomes a design tool when you surface patterns across teams and contexts, then act on those signals.</h2>
            <p>Most programs use assumptions because designers lack real-time data about what works where. Data-informed design means using learning analytics to surface patterns, testing variations based on those insights, and iterating faster than competitors who wait for quarterly reports.</p>
            <p>Think of learning data as a compass, not a scoreboard. Scoreboards tell you where you are. Compasses tell you where to go. When data surfaces what high-performing teams actually use, you know what designs deserve attention. When data shows which activities drive behavior change, you know which programs matter most.</p>
            <h2>Apply one signal each week to inform one design decision.</h2>
            <p>Build a simple weekly routine. Surface three signals: what learning activities do high-performing teams use, what feedback shows learning transfer, what metrics show behavior change. Use those signals to make one small program tweak each week.</p>
            <p>Start small. Pick one signal that&#x27;s easy to access. Track it for two weeks. Apply one design change based on what it shows. Measure whether that change improved outcomes. Then add a second signal and repeat. Growth compounds when you iterate consistently.</p>
            <h2>Research shows data-driven design outperforms assumption-based approaches.</h2>
            <p>Programs built on assumptions have lower impact than those based on user data (Harvard Business Review). Companies that use data to guide product decisions outperform peers by a significant margin (McKinsey). Learning programs that iterate weekly based on feedback see three times better transfer than static programs (Association for Talent Development study).</p>
            <p>Engagement metrics often predict transfer poorly. Behavior change metrics better indicate business impact. The signal-to-noise ratio improves when you combine multiple data sources instead of relying on one.</p>
            <p>Start with one weekly data signal and use it to inform one design decision this week. The compounding effect of small, consistent changes transforms assumption-based programs into data-informed practices.</p>
