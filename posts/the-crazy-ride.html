            <h2>This is different</h2>
            <p>This is not the flash to HTML conversion phase. This is not the mobile learning phase. This is not the gamification and engagement phase. This is not even the AI phase. This is the phase where learning development needs to prove its relevance to the business as a whole, which itself is transforming drastically.</p>

            <p>So the change has to happen on two levels—in fact three levels—rather than just one level. This is going to be a crazy ride.</p>

            <h2>The evolution imperative</h2>
            <p>L&D professionals need to evolve. Fast.</p>

            <p>We've moved past the buzzwords. Now we need to demonstrate value. The business is changing rapidly. Our systems need to keep pace. And we need to show every stakeholder exactly how we're contributing to the bottom line.</p>

            <h2>Three levels of change</h2>
            <p>This isn't about one level of change. It's about three: systems, skills, and measurement. And that's just the beginning.</p>
