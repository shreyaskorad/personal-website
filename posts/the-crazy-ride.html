            <p>This is not the flash to HTML conversion phase. This is not the mobile learning phase. This is not the gamification and engagement phase. This is not even the AI phase.</p>

            <p>This is the phase where learning development needs to prove its relevance to the business as a whole, which itself is transforming drastically.</p>

            <h2>Three levels of change</h2>
            <p>So the change has to happen on two levels. In fact, three levels. Not just one. This is going to be a crazy ride.</p>

            <p>L&D professionals need to evolve. Fast. We have moved past the buzzwords. Now we need to demonstrate value. The business is changing rapidly. Our systems need to keep pace. And we need to show every stakeholder exactly how we are contributing to the bottom line.</p>

            <p>This is not about one level of change. It is about three: systems, skills, and measurement. And that is just the beginning.</p>
