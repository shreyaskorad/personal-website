<h2>Accelerando and the future of L&D</h2>

<p>The accelerando—where AI is deeply integrated into workflows—forces L&D to shift from delivering courses to enabling integrated performance support.</p>

<p>Courses don't disappear. Instead, they narrow in purpose: from everything to what AI can't provide.</p>

<h2>Courses become primers</h2>

<p>Foundations, mental models, and safety nets still matter. People need frameworks before they can use AI effectively. Think of courses as reference materials rather than the full journey.</p>

<h2>Performance support becomes AI-native</h2>

<p>Traditional job aids and help desks lose relevance when AI is already in the flow. The question shifts from "how do we support learners after training?" to "how is this workflow already embedded with support?"</p>

<h2>Learning transfer happens in context</h2>

<p>When learning and work are separated, transfer is hard. The accelerando makes context-native learning default: micro-learnings embedded in tasks with AI that bridges gaps instantly.</p>

<h2>Design for AI-augmented performance</h2>

<p>Consider AI's role in the workflow before designing content. Focus on what AI can't do well: judgment, nuance, ethics, complex trade-offs.</p>

<h2>Treat AI as a new medium</h2>

<p>Create micro-learnings that shape AI behavior: templates, reasoning chains, drafting styles. Prompt literacy becomes a core skill.</p>

<h2>Guardrails over content</h2>

<p>As AI handles surface-level support, your role becomes about guardrails: standards, brand voice, compliance, ethics. Less about "what do I teach?" more about "how do we ensure AI is helpful, safe, and aligned?"</p>

<h2>Shorten the feedback loop</h2>

<p>Learning transfer fails when learners can't apply what they learned quickly. Accelerando tools make this easier: real-time coaching, AI as a sandbox for practice, in-context examples.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Courses survive but differently. The accelerando pushes L&D toward integration-first design where learning happens in the flow of work, with AI as the scaffold—not the replacement.</p>
