            <p>The accelerando has begun. AI is now deeply integrated into systems and workflows.</p>
            <p>This changes everything for L&amp;D. Traditional L&amp;D is built around two assumptions that are now broken.</p>
            <p>First assumption: performance support is needed after training. This is dead when AI is already embedded in workflows. The system provides support at the moment of need. No job aids. No help desks. Just seamless performance.</p>
            <p>Second assumption: courses deliver learning transfer. This is under the radar when AI can answer questions instantly. When AI already knows the workflow and procedures. The gap between learning and application disappears.</p>
            <p>L&amp;D needs a new direction. What does it become when courses and performance support are no longer viable models?</p>
            <p>Think of L&amp;D as workflow intelligence. The people who understand how work actually gets done. The ones who can design systems that work for humans who work with AI. The capability to make workflows better by surfacing what matters when it matters.</p>
            <p>The future of L&amp;D is not about delivering training. It is about owning the intelligence that makes workflows work. That is where the relevance lives in an accelerando world.</p>
