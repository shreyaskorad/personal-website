<h2>Accelerando and the future of L&D</h2>

<p>Where AI is deeply integrated into workflows L&D shifts from delivering courses to enabling performance support.</p>

<p>Courses narrow in purpose to what AI cannot provide.</p>

<h2>Courses become primers</h2>

<p>Foundations mental models and safety nets still matter. People need frameworks before they can use AI effectively. Think of courses as reference materials rather than the full journey.</p>

<h2>Performance support becomes AI-native</h2>

<p>Traditional job aids lose relevance when AI is in the flow. The question shifts from supporting learners after training to how the workflow already embeds support.</p>

<h2>Learning transfer happens in context</h2>

<p>When learning and work are separated transfer is hard. Context native learning becomes default with micro-learnings embedded in tasks and AI bridging gaps instantly.</p>

<h2>Design for AI-augmented performance</h2>

<p>Consider AI's role before designing content. Focus on what AI cannot do well judgment nuance ethics and complex trade-offs.</p>

<h2>Guardrails over content</h2>

<p>AI handles surface level support so your role becomes about guardrails standards brand voice compliance and ethics. Less about what you teach more about ensuring AI is helpful safe and aligned.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Courses survive but differently. The accelerando pushes L&D toward integration first design where learning happens in the flow of work with AI as the scaffold not the replacement.</p>
