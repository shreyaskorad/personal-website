## Training Gap Reality

Most organizations pour resources into learning programs yet see minimal behavior change. The problem isn't content quality. It's how learning moves from workshop to workflow.

## Three Ritual Components

**1. Immediate application checkpoint** happens within forty-eight hours of training. Team members share one concrete change they'll implement using learned frameworks.

**2. Peer feedback session** occurs weekly. Members ask: Did this ritual help you apply what you learned? What blocked you? What support do you need?

**3. Leadership review** happens monthly. Leaders discuss which ritual components worked and which need adjustment.

## Rituals as Essential Practice

Feedback rituals turn abstract learning into measurable behavior. When you implement one ritual within two weeks you create momentum that compounds. Start with the application checkpoint and build from there.
