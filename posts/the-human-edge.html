            <h2>Smaller AI context, larger human responsibility</h2>
            <p>We’re entering a world where models do more with less. Short prompts, quick outputs, and thin context windows will keep costs low and latency fast. That’s great for scale, but it also means the AI is operating on a narrow slice of what matters.</p>
            <p>Humans are the ones who hold the wider map: the history, the intent, the trade-offs, and the politics of a decision. The smaller the AI context, the more important it is for people to decide what really belongs inside it.</p>

            <h2>Context is not just information</h2>
            <p>Context is meaning. It’s the difference between a list of facts and a coherent direction. It’s knowing which edge cases matter, what success actually looks like, and which constraints are real versus imagined. Humans bring that sense-making layer in a way that is hard to compress into a prompt.</p>

            <h2>The new advantage: pattern navigation</h2>
            <p>The people who thrive won’t be the ones with the largest memory of facts. They’ll be the ones who can connect patterns across domains and turn them into clear instructions for machines. That’s the human edge: not bigger context windows, but better context judgment.</p>
            <p>If AI handles the execution, the value shifts to how well we frame the task. The human role is to hold the big picture, curate what matters, and guide the system toward outcomes worth shipping.</p>
