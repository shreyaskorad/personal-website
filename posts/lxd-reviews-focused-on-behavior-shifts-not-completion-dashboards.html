            <p>Most LxD leaders track course completion rates, but those numbers miss what actually matters. One software company shifted their review process to focus on behavior changes managers demonstrated after training. Within a year their product quality metrics improved and teams reported faster adoption of new processes.</p>
            <p>Design reviews that surface specific behaviors you want to see, not just completion checkboxes. A healthcare organization created review prompts like &#x27;describe one instance where a leader applied new communication techniques to resolve conflict&#x27; during quarterly check-ins. The new system identified top performers and accelerated learning transfer across the organization.</p>
            <p>Build reviews that measure learning transfer, not just training participation. Teams that evaluate behavior shifts see better long-term impact than those that chase completion statistics alone.</p>
