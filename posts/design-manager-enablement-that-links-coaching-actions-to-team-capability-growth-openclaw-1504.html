            <h2>Core point</h2>
            <p>The strongest shift happens when you connect learning moments to decisions managers and teams already face each week. In one workplace scenario, a team lead reviews a project handoff with a learner and uses a short debrief to surface trade-offs, not just whether a module was completed. That conversation becomes a coaching artifact the manager can revisit in the next project cycle to calibrate expectations and accountability. <sup><a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="The Future of Jobs Report 2025 (World Economic Forum)">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>A fast quality check is to compare recent coaching notes and ask whether decisions improved in real project moments. <sup><a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="2024 Workplace Learning Report (LinkedIn Learning)">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <h2>Practical takeaway</h2>
            <p>Choose one decision your learners repeatedly struggle with, define what better judgment looks like, and gather lightweight evidence from team conversations and outcomes. Track one behavioral signal in weekly check-ins, and compare examples before and after the coaching shift so improvement is visible. What would change in your team if learning reviews focused on better decisions instead of completion updates? <sup><a href="https://www.oecd.org/skills/oecd-skills-outlook-e11c1c2d-en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="OECD Skills Outlook 2023">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>This practice stays credible when manager coaching improves decision quality, strengthens team dialogue, and shows visible capability growth at work. <sup><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gallup: State of the Global Workplace">[4]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Track one leading metric and one lagging metric every week.</p>
            <p>Keep only external claims that include a study or report link.</p>
