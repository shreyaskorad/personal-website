            <p>The problem is not intent but the lack of structured practice on real decisions.</p>
            <p>Effective judgment coaching happens in real conversations not slide decks. Managers should ask one question after every team decision: what evidence guided your choice and what would you do differently next time. This simple practice surfaces hidden assumptions and builds decision muscle over time.</p>
            <p>Three practices turn judgment coaching from awkward to systematic. First, schedule ten-minute judgment checks during weekly one-on-ones. Ask teams to describe one recent decision and how they would improve it. Second, create a space where employees make real decisions, not just scenarios. Let them handle customer calls or product launches with coaching support. Third, use learning data to surface blind spots, not completion metrics. Review team decision patterns to identify recurring misjudgments.</p>
            <p>Managers report increased confidence after three weeks of judgment coaching conversations. Teams show measurable improvement in error reduction and faster decision cycles.</p>
            <p>The most common objection is that managers don&#x27;t have time for coaching. But judgment coaching takes minutes, not hours. The impact compounds when practiced weekly.</p>
            <p>Track one leading metric (decision accuracy) and one lagging metric (error reduction) every week.</p>
            <p>Keep only external claims that include a study or report link.</p>
            <p>Review team decision patterns monthly to identify recurring misjudgments.</p>
            <p>The future of manager enablement isn&#x27;t more training. It is consistent judgment coaching on real decisions.</p>
