            <p>The goal is not to collect more dashboards. The goal is to show how better learning decisions changed behavior in work that leaders care about.</p>
            <p>In one workplace scenario, a manager reviews a project debrief with a team member and notes how a different handoff decision prevented recurring confusion in delivery.</p>
            <p>Pick one capability outcome, pair it with one business-relevant signal, and document short evidence notes from team conversations. Keep the story tied to decisions, not activity volume.</p>
            <p>If you had to explain learning impact in one minute to a business leader, what evidence would you trust enough to put on the table?</p>
            <p>Learning evidence becomes useful when it helps teams make better decisions and gives business reviews a clear, credible story of capability growth.</p>
