            <p>Most learning programs produce detailed dashboards that sit on a shelf while decision makers request a quick snapshot for quarterly reviews. The gap creates a perception that learning data is noisy and hard to act on. When evidence is buried under layers of charts, it loses its impact and teams revert to intuition rather than data.</p>
            <p>Reflective question: How often do you find yourself summarizing learning metrics in a meeting because the original report is too dense?</p>
            <p>Start by defining three business questions you need to answer each review – for example, skill adoption, performance impact, and cost efficiency. Then map each question to a single learning metric and pull only that data into a one‑page brief. A recent pilot at a tech firm used this approach to replace a 20‑page deck with a two‑page summary, freeing time for deeper discussion.</p>
            <p>Practical scenario: Your product team wants to know if a new onboarding module improved time‑to‑competency. Instead of sharing the full LMS report, you extract the average competency score and a short quote from a participant, and present it alongside the cost saved.</p>
            <p>The key is to treat learning evidence as a decision‑support tool, not a reporting exercise, and to iterate the brief each quarter based on stakeholder feedback.</p>
            <p>By trimming the reporting overhead and focusing on the questions that matter, you turn learning evidence into a clear signal that drives better business decisions.</p>
