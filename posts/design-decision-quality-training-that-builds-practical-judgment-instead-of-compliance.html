<p>What if learning improved this week’s decisions instead of next quarter’s compliance scores? A 2022 Harvard Business Review study found that 70% of employees prefer on‑the‑job learning, highlighting the shift from static courses to embedded, real‑time guidance. By weaving AI‑driven prompts directly into tools, teams receive instant feedback that sharpens judgment and reduces error rates. Measuring success moves beyond completion percentages to metrics like time‑to‑competence and error reduction, which correlate with a 15% boost in overall performance according to a 2024 Deloitte analysis. Leaders can design lightweight learning cues that surface at the point of decision, ensuring knowledge is applied when it matters most. This approach not only accelerates skill acquisition but also builds a culture of continuous improvement, where every task becomes a chance to grow. Start small: pick one high-frequency decision, improve its quality, and let the results shape the next change.</p>
