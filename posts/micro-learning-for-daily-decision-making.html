            <p>Micro-learning works because it delivers relevant information at the exact moment managers face a decision, not weeks after training. Instead of forcing managers to remember what they learned, micro-learning systems provide context-aware support embedded in their existing tools. Most frontline managers don&#x27;t have time to analyze their own performance, but point-of-decision learning surfaces insights they&#x27;d miss without additional tools.</p>
            <p>Implement point-of-decision micro-learning by identifying the five most common decision types managers face, creating brief contextual tips for each, and embedding them in the tools managers already use like Slack, email, or CRM systems. The first week, AI surfaces patterns like &#x27;revenue negotiation tips when you receive a difficult objection message&#x27; and &#x27;team conflict resolution frameworks when you notice escalating tension.&#x27; Measure whether managers who receive micro-learning support improve faster than those who don&#x27;t, using decision quality metrics from performance reviews and daily outcome tracking.</p>
            <p>Frontline managers need learning support exactly when they need it, not weeks later in a training room. Point-of-decision micro-learning delivers contextual wisdom at the right moment, turning learning into measurable performance improvement.</p>
