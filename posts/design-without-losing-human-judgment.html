        <article class="post-content">
            <p>I watched a design team use AI to draft a leadership scenario in minutes, then spend far longer repairing what mattered most. The language sounded polished, but the tradeoffs were shallow and the context felt generic. The draft was fast, yet the decision quality was weak.</p>
            <p>That moment clarified the boundary for me. AI can accelerate structure, options, and first drafts, but it cannot own consequences. In workplace learning, consequences are everything. If a learner applies the advice in a tense conversation tomorrow, who carries the cost of a bad call?</p>
            <p>The better operating model is simple. Let the model generate, then force a human review for intent, risk, and context before anything ships. I care less about how quickly content appears and more about whether the final design helps people make better decisions under pressure.</p>
            <p>When teams treat AI as a partner in production and keep judgment as the final gate, output gets sharper and trust stays intact. Speed still matters, but direction matters more. That is the balance worth protecting.</p>
