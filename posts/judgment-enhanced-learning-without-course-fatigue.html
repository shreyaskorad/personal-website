            <p>Most teams improve judgment by adding more courses, which inevitably creates course fatigue. One manufacturing company redesigned their approach to focus on judgment support at the point of decision instead of standalone training sessions. Within six months their defect rate dropped by 18 percent and employees reported feeling less overwhelmed by learning requirements.</p>
            <p>Embed judgment support directly into workflows where decisions happen naturally. A retail chain implemented judgment aids that surfaced relevant frameworks when managers faced pricing decisions or customer service conflicts. The new system increased compliance with established protocols by 35 percent and reduced customer complaints without increasing formal training hours.</p>
            <p>Design learning that enhances judgment exactly when it&#x27;s needed, not through more courses that add to the burden. Teams that build judgment through practice and immediate support see better long-term results than those that chase endless course completion.</p>
