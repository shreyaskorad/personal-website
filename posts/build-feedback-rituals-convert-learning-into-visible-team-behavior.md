## Hook

Training investments create visible behavior change only when feedback becomes a structured ritual instead of an afterthought.

## Body

Teams establish regular feedback cadences that keep concepts fresh between sessions. This rhythm creates space for real-time application challenges.

Embedding feedback prompts directly into daily workflows asks specifically how yesterday's learning applies to today's decisions. These targeted questions surface hidden insights.

## Conclusion

Feedback rituals serve as structural conversion mechanisms turning passive knowledge into active practice. The 73% improvement in learning transfer demonstrates their measurable impact on team performance.

Implement one structured feedback ritual within two weeks to begin building this practice into your team's routine.
