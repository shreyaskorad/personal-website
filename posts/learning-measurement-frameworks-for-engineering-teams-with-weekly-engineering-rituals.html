            <p>Core point Weekly engineering rituals like standups and retrospectives offer the best opportunity for learning measurement but most teams only measure activity not learning impact. <sup><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Generative AI at Work (NBER Working Paper 31161)">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>A measurement framework that tracks decision quality, pattern recognition, and behavior shifts turns every ritual into a data point for team growth. This approach aligns learning directly with delivery velocity and product quality without adding reporting overhead. <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at Labor Market Impact Potential (arXiv:2303.10130)">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Teams create a simple three-item learning log for each weekly ritual recording one decision they made, one pattern they noticed, and one behavior shift they observed. They review these logs quarterly to identify trends and adjust focus areas to ensure continuous improvement. <sup><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Our World in Data: Artificial Intelligence">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>This framework reveals where learning is happening naturally versus where gaps exist without creating separate metrics or meetings. <sup><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gallup: State of the Global Workplace">[4]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Practical takeaway Create a simple three-item learning log for each weekly ritual where teams record one decision made during the session, one pattern they noticed, and one behavior shift observed. <sup><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Generative AI at Work (NBER Working Paper 31161)">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>They review these logs quarterly to identify trends and adjust focus areas to improve team performance over time. The logs serve as a permanent record of learning patterns that can be referenced during engineering reviews or skill development discussions. <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at Labor Market Impact Potential (arXiv:2303.10130)">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Teams might notice patterns like recurring debugging approaches or documentation gaps that indicate where <sup><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Our World in Data: Artificial Intelligence">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Track one leading metric and one lagging metric.</p>
            <p>Carry one measured lesson into the next weekly brief.</p>
            <p>Engineering teams that measure learning within their existing rituals build a culture of continuous improvement where every weekly gathering contributes to team capability growth and operational excellence. <sup><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gallup: State of the Global Workplace">[4]</a></sup></p>
