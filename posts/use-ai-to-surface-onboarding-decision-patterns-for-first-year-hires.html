        </header>

        <article class="post-content">
            <p>First-year hires drown in decisions every week. They choose which files to share, how to phrase emails, and which trade-offs to make. Most onboarding programs check boxes but never analyze these decisions. The result is a high rate of avoidable mistakes. AI tools can now surface patterns from these thousands of decisions, showing which choices work and which ones don't. Leaders can use this data to guide new hires toward better choices faster.</p>

            <h2>AI tools analyze which decisions to repeat and which ones to avoid</h2>

            <p>Most AI tools focus on general learning. The real opportunity is in onboarding-specific decision patterns. AI can analyze which decisions first-year hires repeat, flag errors that show up again and again, and suggest alternatives based on what works for high performers. A simple approach is to pick one high-frequency decision type. Collect the first year of decisions. Let AI surface patterns. Then share those patterns with new hires before they face the same choices.</p>

            <h2>Start with the decision that happens most often in your role</h2>

            <p>Choose which emails to include in team updates, how to prioritize customer requests, or which data points to highlight in reports. Collect data on these decisions for 30 days. Use AI to surface patterns and suggest improvements. Share the insights with the next cohort. Measure whether error rates and time-to-competence improve. Iterate based on what the data shows. This approach builds a culture where every decision becomes a learning opportunity.</p>
