            <p class="post-lead">I care about design learning for decision quality, not completion rates only when it changes the judgment teams use in daily work, because learning that never touches decisions does not survive pressure. If a manager cannot point to a clearer call during real work, the effort is still theory.</p>

            <p>A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.</p>
            <p>You can run a short pilot around a focused behavior change, then document what shifted in the team conversation and what did not. That record is more useful than adding another generic course asset.</p>
            <p>This also improves quality control in automation: shorter posts stay readable, but the argument still deepens when each paragraph adds a different layer of evidence or judgment. The result feels like a practitioner note, not a template.</p>
            <p>When this becomes part of normal team practice, people stop treating learning as separate from delivery and start using it to improve judgment where it matters most. That shift is usually the difference between activity and capability.</p>
