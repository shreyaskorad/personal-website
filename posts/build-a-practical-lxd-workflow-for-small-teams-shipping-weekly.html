            <p class="post-lead">Small teams that ship weekly often struggle to incorporate learning design into their tight delivery cycles without creating administrative overhead. This creates a gap between learning intent and actual delivery outcomes.</p>

            <p>A practical workflow keeps learning design tightly coupled with weekly sprints by integrating learning checkpoints directly into the existing process. Evidence-based learning that links to business metrics shows higher adoption compared to standalone training initiatives (source: learning impact research).</p>
            <p>A product team might identify a new feature&#x27;s training needs during sprint planning, design a five-minute inline learning artifact during the sprint, and verify application during the sprint review. This keeps learning continuous and connected to the work being shipped.</p>
            <p>The most effective LXD workflows for small teams embed learning into existing rhythms rather than creating parallel processes. Reflective question: What weekly activity could you design a learning checkpoint around?</p>
