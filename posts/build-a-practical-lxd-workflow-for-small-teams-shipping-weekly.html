            <p class="post-lead">Small teams often get stuck trying to build perfect LxD systems instead of shipping useful learning experiences. I recently watched a three-person LxD team spend three weeks designing their first micro-learning platform. By week four they had built nothing the business could use.</p>

                <article class="post-content">
            <p>Pick one delivery method like a 15-minute weekly video or a three-question monthly email. The consistency beats the complexity. One software company built a weekly 10-minute code review video series that became their most valuable content.</p>
            <p>Ask about relevance, clarity, and actionability. Two engineering teams using this approach improved their weekly content by 40 percent in six weeks.</p>
            <p>Teams that commit to weekly publishing never have time to overthink or perfect. The velocity itself creates focus and discipline.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What weekly learning format would give your team the most immediate value in their daily work?</li>
                <li>Complete your weekly learning content by Thursday afternoon each week</li>
                <li>Share it on Friday for Monday discussions</li>
                <li>This simple rhythm keeps everyone aligned without complex tools or processes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Weekly delivery beats perfection. Small wins compound faster than perfect systems. Practical LxD workflows that ship weekly provide the fastest path to measurable learning impact for busy teams.</p>
