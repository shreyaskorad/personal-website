            <p class="post-lead">The most useful test for design onboarding that builds role judgment instead of checklist compliance is simple: can people make sharper decisions with less confusion during real project work. Completion metrics can look strong while workplace behavior stays unchanged.</p>

            <p>A practical scenario is a cross-functional handoff where everyone agrees on goals but no one names the decision criteria early enough. The team then revisits the same issue in the next standup.</p>
            <p>You can run a short pilot around a focused behavior change, then document what shifted in the team conversation and what did not. That record is more useful than adding another generic course asset.</p>
            <p>This also improves quality control in automation: shorter posts stay readable, but the argument still deepens when each paragraph adds a different layer of evidence or judgment. The result feels like a practitioner note, not a template.</p>
            <p>I keep this model grounded by asking teams to capture brief evidence from real meetings, then reflect on whether the decision logic improved. That habit builds credibility because the learning story stays tied to workplace behavior.</p>
            <p>What recurring team decision is the best place to test this approach first, before you scale it across the rest of the learning program?</p>
