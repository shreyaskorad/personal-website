        <article class="post-content">
            <p>I have seen teams celebrate course completion while managers still escalate the same avoidable issues. The learning looked successful in the dashboard, but behavior on the floor told a different story. That gap is exactly where most programs lose credibility.</p>
            <p>The shift starts when we design around decisions, not modules. Instead of asking whether people finished content, I ask whether they can make a better call in a real moment. Can a team lead handle a delivery tradeoff without defaulting to burnout? Can a supervisor coach performance without turning the conversation into compliance theater?</p>
            <p>Once those moments are explicit, design gets sharper. Scenarios become specific, feedback becomes useful, and managers can observe changes in how people reason under pressure. The program stops feeling like content distribution and starts feeling like capability building.</p>
            <p>Completion still has operational value, but it should never be the headline metric. If learning does not improve judgment where work is actually happening, we have activity, not impact.</p>
