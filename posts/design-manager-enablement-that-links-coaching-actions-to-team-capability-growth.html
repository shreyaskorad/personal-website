                <article class="post-content">
            <p>Manager enablement programs often separate coaching development from team capability building. This gap appears because most coaching frameworks focus on the conversation itself without connecting it to explicit capability building goals or business outcomes. Without systems that link coaching actions to capability outcomes, managers rely on intuition rather than data to track progress. This creates a disconnect where well-intentioned coaching remains informal and uneven across teams, limiting its impact on team performance and individual growth.</p>
            <p>Start with three measurable capability dimensions: technical skill depth, collaborative practices, and problem-solving approach. Map each coaching conversation to one of these dimensions and track specific action items with clear completion criteria. When a coaching session concludes, document not just the discussion points but the capability improvement expected. Over time</p>
            <p>Use simple spreadsheets or learning management</p>
            <p>Design managers who build systems that link coaching actions directly to capability outcomes create teams that improve continuously rather than relying on sporadic advice. The framework requires minimal setup but delivers outsized impact when applied consistently.</p>
