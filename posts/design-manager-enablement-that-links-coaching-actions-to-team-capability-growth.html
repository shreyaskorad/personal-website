            <p>Manager enablement programs often separate coaching development from team capability building. One software company redesigned their approach to link every coaching session directly to measurable team capability growth. Within months their engineering teams showed faster skill adoption and better cross-functional collaboration.</p>
            <p>Connect coaching actions to team capability goals, not individual coaching skills. A retail chain implemented manager enablement that tracked coaching conversations against capability-building goals like communication skills, conflict resolution, and technical problem solving. The new system increased team performance metrics by 25 percent and reduced turnover.</p>
            <p>Design enablement that ties coaching conversations to team capability outcomes, not coach performance. Teams that build capability through focused coaching see better long-term results than those that treat coaching as separate from team development.</p>
