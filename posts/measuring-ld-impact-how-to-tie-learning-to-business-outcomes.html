            <p>First, performance improvement timeframes. Second, behavior change frequency. Third, business outcome contribution. Track these against specific goals like reduced error rates or faster decision cycles.</p>
            <p>Ask stakeholders what decisions they need to make better after learning. Then align metrics to those decisions. A sales training might track proposal close rate improvements over three months. A compliance program might measure report submission accuracy.</p>
            <p>Define one business question for each learning program. Choose one or two metrics that directly answer that question. Collect data consistently over time. Compare results against baseline and benchmark against similar teams.</p>
            <p>What measurement system would your stakeholders actually use? Building measurement into programs from the start saves time later. Start small, validate early, then scale what works.</p>
