            <p>Learning programs often fail because feedback is isolated and doesn&#x27;t connect to daily actions. One software company redesigned their feedback process to include weekly check-ins focused specifically on applying learning from previous sessions. Six months later their team performance improved by 23 percent and managers reported higher adoption of new practices.</p>
            <p>Tie feedback directly to the learning you want to see in daily work. A healthcare system created feedback rituals that surface questions like &#x27;which new communication technique did you use this week&#x27; during weekly team meetings. The new approach increased practice adoption by 40 percent and patients reported better communication overall. Build rituals that connect learning to actions, not just completion.</p>
            <p>Teams that integrate feedback into their routines see better long-term results than those that treat feedback as a separate task.</p>
