            <p>AI infrastructure is expensive. Data centers, GPUs, and electricity. That money is concentrated in a few companies and investors.</p>
            <p>The subscription model creates a real circular dependency. People need jobs to pay for AI subscriptions, but those subscriptions cut jobs that would pay for them.</p>
            <p>The risk is that AI becomes a moat for the already advantaged. Open-source, public investment, regulation, and access programs can help spread the benefits beyond the big players.</p>
            <p>It is not just who pays for AI, but who gets to use it. The focus must be on ensuring broad access rather than maximizing profits. This is a systemic issue that needs deliberate solutions from governments, companies, and society at large together.</p>
            <p>If everyone is losing jobs, who pays for AI infrastructure? It is funded by concentrated capital and by customers, and the risk is who gets left out.</p>
