            <p class="post-lead">Most teams add more training when judgment gaps appear instead of creating practice opportunities. One design team shifted their approach to daily judgment exercises embedded in actual work. They asked developers to explain their design trade-offs and question assumptions before making decisions. The team tracked decision quality over six months and found improvements in complex problem solving and stakeholder alignment. No new courses were added but judgment capabilities grew through repeated practice in real scenarios. Leaders also used these discussions to surface blind spots and strengthen collective decision quality across projects.</p>
