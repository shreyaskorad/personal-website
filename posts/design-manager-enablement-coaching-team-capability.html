        <p>Manager enablement programs often focus on abstract development goals like improving leadership presence or enhancing communication skills. This approach misses what actually matters to teams. You can certify managers as "excellent coaches" while their teams lack specific capability growth.</p>
        <p>Review your current manager enablement program. Ask yourself which manager coaching sessions have directly enabled a measurable capability shift in their team members. If you cannot identify clear examples, your program is missing the coaching-to-capability connection that drives real impact.</p>
        <p>A practical framework starts with defining specific capability outcomes before coaching conversations begin. Instead of generic feedback, coaches should focus on "What specific team capability will this coaching action develop?" A senior engineer who receives coaching on technical delegation might focus on enabling junior developers to take ownership of features. This creates a clear capability outcome linked directly to a concrete coaching action.</p>
        <p>Capability growth requires repeated application in real work contexts. Manager coaching programs that include follow-up conversations specifically checking capability application strengthen learning transfer. One client designed a quarterly "capability review" where managers reported which coaching actions they implemented and what capability shifts resulted. Teams showed measurable improvement in the targeted capabilities within six months.</p>
        <p>Manager enablement works when coaching directly builds team capability. The most effective programs connect specific coaching actions to observable team skill development. Your next coaching session should focus on one capability shift rather than general development goals.</p>
