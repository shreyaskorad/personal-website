      <guid>https://shreyaskorad.in/posts/use-data-informed-learning-decisions-not-assumptions.html</guid>
      <description>Data beats intuition when you use it to inform decisions, not justify them. Small, consistent data-informed changes compound faster than big assumptions.</description>

      <guid>https://shreyaskorad.in/posts/design-learning-for-decision-quality-not-completion-rates.html</guid>

      <guid>https://shreyaskorad.in/posts/the-object-without-attachment.html</guid>
