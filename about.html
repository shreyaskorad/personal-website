            <h1>I took the long way into learning design. It made all the difference.</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Most instructional designers came up through education or HR. 
                I came through advertising, gamification, and a obsession with 
                why some experiences captivate us while others fade from memory.
            </p>
        </header>

        <article class="about-narrative">
            <p>
                I started my career running a marketing and advertising company. 
                The work was all about one thing: capturing attention. In a world 
                of infinite distractions, how do you make someone stop, notice, 
                and actually care about what you're saying?
            </p>

            <p>
                That question led me to gamification. Not the shallow "slap some 
                badges on it" variety, but the deep mechanics that make experiences 
                genuinely compelling. I became fascinated by motivation: why we 
                engage with some things obsessively and abandon others instantly. 
                What makes a game feel impossible to put down? What makes learning 
                feel like a chore?
            </p>

            <p>
                The more I explored, the more I realized these weren't separate 
                questions. The principles that make games engaging are the same 
                principles that make learning stick. Challenge. Feedback. Progress. 
                Meaning. The difference is in how, and whether, we apply them.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-block">
                <p>
                    That realization became my bridge into learning and development, 
                    where I've spent the last 7+ years applying everything I learned 
                    about attention, engagement, and behavior change to the challenge 
                    of helping people actually learn.

                <h2>What I actually believe about learning</h2>

                <p>
                    Here's the uncomfortable truth about most corporate training: 
                    it's designed for the organization, not the learner. It measures 
                    completion, not competence. It prioritizes coverage over 
                    understanding. And then everyone wonders why nothing changes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe in a different approach.
                </p>

                <div class="philosophy-grid">
                    <div class="philosophy-item">
                        <h3>Learning should feel good</h3>
                        <p>
                            Not in a "fun and games" way, but in the way that mastering 
                            something difficult feels good. People learn what they engage 
                            with. If your training feels like a chore, that's a design 
                            problem, not a learner problem.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Engagement without outcomes is entertainment</h3>
                        <p>
                            Interactivity, gamification, storytelling: these are powerful 
                            tools. But they're tools, not goals. If learners are engaged 
                            but can't do anything new afterward, you've built a game, 
                            not a learning experience.

                            them? Sometimes the answer isn't training at all.

                <h2>What makes my perspective different</h2>

                <p>
                    Most learning designers fall into one of two camps. There are 
                    the creative types, strong on storytelling, visuals, and 
                    engagement, but less rigorous about learning science and 
                    measurement. And there are the analytical types, meticulous 
                    about objectives and assessments, but the experiences they 
                    create feel clinical and forgettable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My unconventional path means I don't fit neatly into either camp.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From advertising, I learned to think like a creative director: 
                    How do you make something that cuts through the noise? That 
                    people actually want to spend time with? That evokes emotion 
                    and sticks in memory?
                </p>

                <p>
                    From gamification, I learned to think like a game designer: 
                    How do you create sustained motivation? How do you make 
                    challenge feel rewarding instead of frustrating? How do you 
                    design systems that people choose to engage with?
                </p>

                <p>
                    From L&D, I learned to think like a strategist: How do you 
                    connect learning to business outcomes? How do you measure what 
                    matters? How do you design for behavior change, not just 
                    knowledge transfer?
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-block">
                    <p>
                        I bring a creative director's eye for engagement, a game 
                        designer's understanding of motivation, and an instructional 
                        designer's commitment to outcomes. That combination is rare, and 
                        it shapes everything I create.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="narrative-section">
                <h2>What I'm most interested in</h2>

                <p>
                    I'm particularly drawn to problems everyone else finds boring. 
                    Compliance training. Mandatory courses. The content that 
                    employees click through as fast as possible just to check a box.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's something deeply satisfying about taking material that 
                    everyone dreads and finding a way to make it genuinely useful, maybe 
                    even engaging. If you can make ethics training feel relevant, 
                    you can make anything work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm also fascinated by the gap between what we know and what we 
                    do. Learning science has made enormous strides in understanding 
                    how people actually learn, yet most training programs ignore 
                    the research entirely. That gap is where I spend a lot of my 
                    thinking.

                <p>
                    When I'm not designing learning experiences, I'm usually 
                    exploring how other fields solve similar problems. Game design. 
                    UX research. Behavioral economics. Narrative theory. The best 
                    ideas often come from unexpected places, and the boundaries 
                    between disciplines are more porous than we pretend.

                    I also believe in learning by doing, which means I'm usually 
                    tinkering with something. Testing a new approach. Breaking 
                    things. Figuring out what works by trying it.
