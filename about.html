                <p class="section-label">The backstory</p>
                <h2>From advertising to learning design</h2>
                <div class="about-prose">
                    <p>
                        I graduated in media with a specialisation in advertising and spent a few years in the ad world. Somewhere along the way, I got pulled into gamification — the idea that game mechanics could shape behaviour and drive real engagement fascinated me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That interest became a bridge. I realised that the same principles that make games compelling could make learning experiences genuinely effective. In 2019, I joined <a href="https://www.upsidelearning.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upside Learning</a> as a consultant, and I've been there since — moving through learning experience design, solutions, pre-sales, and now working across consulting and innovation initiatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I focus on how gamification, learning science, business-problem consulting, data, and AI come together to shape new-age learning strategies and experiences.

                <h2>Learning is not about the curriculum</h2>
                <div class="about-prose">
                    <p>
                        If I had to distil it down to one thing — most learning programmes get it wrong because they focus on delivering a curriculum. The real question is different: <strong>what tasks do people need to do better at work, and how can we help them do that?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To deliver on that promise, you need to pull from many places — engaging game mechanics, design principles, storytelling, learning science, and data. No single framework does it all. The craft is in knowing which levers to pull and when.

                <div class="about-prose">
                    <p>
                        At Upside Learning, I work across the spectrum — from conceptualising learning experiences for different clients and building early prototypes, to wireframing and shaping the solution direction. I work in pre-sales and consulting, helping organisations figure out the right approach before a single slide is designed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In parallel, I run experiments that push the boundaries of what's possible in learning design — from AI-driven content to data-informed personalisation to new ways of thinking about technology in L&D. It's the part of the work that keeps things interesting.

                    <p>
                        Good work comes from good inputs. I read widely — fiction and non-fiction — and binge sci-fi series adapted from books. I play games every week, clocking a couple of hours to keep the creative instincts sharp. That's where the interest in gamification started, and it's still where a lot of ideas come from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love playing with AI tools and used to spend a lot of time in the AV world. These days, outside of work, my time belongs to my daughter Ananya — she's about ten months old, so life is beautifully full.
