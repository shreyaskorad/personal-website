# Blog Writing Rules (Strict)

These rules are mandatory for all blog posts on this site.

**Voice and style**
- Always apply the Humanizer guidance described below.
- Write in a conversational, direct tone as if speaking to the reader.
- Keep posts between 180 and 300 words.
- Never use em dashes.
- Do not use bullet lists.
- Do not use H2/H3 headers in the final post body.
- Keep the core concept as the opening and the ending. Stay anchored to it throughout.
- No blockquotes or callout boxes with a side line.

**Humanizer guidance (must follow)**
"Humanizer" is an open-source skill file plugin for Anthropics Claude Code AI assistant, released by tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen in January 2026. The plugin is designed to make AI-generated text sound less robotic and more natural by intentionally avoiding 24 specific language and formatting patterns that have been identified as markers of AI writing.
**Humanizer pattern mapping**
- No em dashes → Pattern 13: Em dash overuse.
- Use sentence case in headings → Pattern 16: Title Case in Headings.
