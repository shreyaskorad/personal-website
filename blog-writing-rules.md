These rules are mandatory for all blog posts on this site.

**Voice and style**

**Humanizer guidance (must follow)**
"Humanizer" is an open-source skill file plugin for Anthropics Claude Code AI assistant, released by tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen in January 2026. The plugin is designed to make AI-generated text sound less robotic and more natural by intentionally avoiding 24 specific language and formatting patterns that have been identified as markers of AI writing.
